<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ready?
<Builder> ye
<Architect> looks like we're building a tripod thing
<Architect> okay, so, start by placing two green blocks near the center in a staircase
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah!
<Architect> okay, now put a blue block to continue the staircase
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, now put a red block two spaces right, down, and towards you with respect to the blue block
<Architect> near the corner of the building space
<Architect> does the building grid look white to you?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> the first one was right!
<Builder> yeah
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> only the block closer to the grid edge needs to be there
<Architect> the other one doesn't
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> perfect! :)
<Builder> ok cool
<Architect> now, put another red block so that it's halfway between the current red and blue one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> one space higher, so it's touching the blue one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> yeah! :)
<Architect> now, if you can imagine a tripod, you'll want two yellow blocks in the reverse pattern of the red ones
<Architect> yeah on that side :)
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now, make a tower of two more blue blocks on top of the first one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> and a purple one on top of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> and now two more purple blocks to make a row of 3, opposite the green blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Builder> in that direction?
<Architect> yep! :)
<Architect> and now you'll want another diagonal row of purple blocks opposite the yellow ones
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-4]
<Architect> perfect! and one more diagonal purple row opposite the red ones
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> beautiful! :)
<Builder> work of art
<Architect> truly :o
