<Builder> Ok
<Architect> ok first you need to make an upside down T out of blue blocks near the middle of the space
<Architect> 3 across 1 tall
<Builder> Ok
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> What should I do next?
<Architect> now make another one parallel to it one space away from the first
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> yep
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> now build an orange bar on top of them connecting the 2
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> now make that a 3x3 orange platform
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> now place 3 orange blocks on top of the side youre facing
<Builder> Is everything ok
<Builder> OK
<Architect> yep
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> now do 3 out but 1 edge is red the other 2 are orange
<Builder> Is this another platform, and which of the 3 should be red?
<Architect> this is just out 1 and it just has to be one of the outside ones
<Architect> to be red
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> yep like that
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> now break the 3 orange ones so the thing you just made comes off the platform diagonally
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> sorta just break the 2 oranges on top of the platform
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> Ok?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> Cool, what's next?
<Architect> now put 2 oranges on the far side of the red one so its 1x3
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> no close just break those and make it so the oranges sort of run along the platform
<Builder> Do you have any guesses about what we are building
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> kinda like a railing
<Builder> Ah, ok
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> it kinda looks like a weird bird
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> so repeat the railing thing on the other side
<Builder> Ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> Next up?
<Architect> now on the opposide side in the middle place a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> Out by one, or there?
