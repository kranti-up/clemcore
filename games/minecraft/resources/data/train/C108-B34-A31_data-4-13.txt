<Architect> Good, we will be buildig the U of I Block "I"
<Builder> what colors are required?
<Architect> This first sequence will be made of blue blocks
<Architect> In the middle of the white blocks, build a line of five blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Perfect! Now build six more blocks on top of one of the end blocks
<Builder> vertical or horizantal(flat)
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:2]
<Builder> that good?
<Architect> That's right
<Builder> egg-cellent
<Architect> Now on the other end, build six more blocks on top so you have two towers on either side of the base

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that
<Architect> Great! Now connect the two top blocks, you should only need three blue blocks to do this
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Builder> I'm guessing this is the frame?
<Architect> Correct
<Architect> We will build the "I" portion now with orange blocks
<Architect> Put three orange blocks within the base of the frame so they are on top of the first layer of blue
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> same thing on top?
<Architect> Yes, now build upward from the middle orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Same thing on top to finish the
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> "I"
<Architect> Perfect!
