<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello! ready?
<Builder> yup!
<Architect> alright. we're gonna start with two green blocks next to each other in the center
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> actually, make that 4 in a 2x2 square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> or flat?
<Architect> both! it should be like a staircase
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> so two more on the ground
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> okay, now, continue that staircase with a 2x3 stack in the back
<Architect> but make the top row yellow

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, now, in front of the low end of the staircase, put a row of 4 orange blocks
<Architect> it should be centered in front

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> the center two should be in front of the green staircase
<Architect> so perpendicular to what you currently have
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]

<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> perfect! now delete the center two
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, now, stack another orange block on each existing orange block

<Architect> and a purple one on each of those
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> and then put another purple block next to the current purple ones, extending out to the sides
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> this
<Builder> ?
<Architect> perfect! :)

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, perfect! now make a row of 6 purple blocks in front of the current 4
<Architect> so they should be attached to the current ones
<Builder> a column going up
<Builder> or a row on the ground?

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Builder> did we run out of spacE?
<Builder> I hope not lol
<Architect> no, we're good :)

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> and connect the top blue blocks using two more blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> alright, almost done
<Architect> underneath the right inner blue block, put two red ones

[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Builder> like a door?
<Architect> yeah, like that!
<Architect> this is the hardest first round i've ever had
