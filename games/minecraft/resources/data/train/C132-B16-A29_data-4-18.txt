[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> you got it!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:3]
<Builder> fun shape
<Architect> yes
<Architect> one more on top of each then remove the bottom blocks
<Architect> so it is suspended in air
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> now we need to replace 4 of these blocks with red blocks
<Architect> starting from the left
<Architect> oops
<Architect> it's 5 high
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> so we need one more on top
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:3]
<Builder> no problem!
<Architect> thank you
<Architect> ok so replacing with red blocks:
<Architect> 2nd from top
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> middle
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> 2nd from top
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> greeeeeat!
