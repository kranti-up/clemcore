<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> and we're back
<Architect> this is gonna be a difficult one lol
<Builder> we got this
<Architect> okay so let's start on the edge closest to you
<Architect> make a 1x2 column of red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> okay so right behind that column, make a 1x3 column of blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> so on the top blue block, make 3 additional blocks to the right of it (in blue)
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> so under the most right blue block (that you just made), put 2 additional blocks under it so it makes a column and touches the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> perfect, so to the left of that newly made column, make a column of 2 reds
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> other side, so that it's under the little doorframe thing of blue
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> great, so move to the right so that the new blue colum is facing you
<Architect> okay so make a 1x3 colum of orange on the right side of the blue column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> okay good, now to the right of that orange column, make a 1x2 orange column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay good, so on top of the blue and 2 orange columns, place 1 purple column on top of each column respectively
<Builder> how tall
<Architect> just one purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great, now can you put 1 layer of purple block sticking out towards you? so that they're branching off
<Architect> just one layer
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> we'll do the same with the side to the left, with the red columns
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> so make an additional layer of purple on top of the blue
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> okay so go back to that view
<Architect> can you get rid of the purple on the 1x2 red column and the purple block to the left of it?
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> good, now fill the space between the 2 purples (on top of the blue) with purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> okay so on that top layer of purple, stick 1 additional layer of purple so it's sticking out towards you
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-6]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-6]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> great, now get rid of the left and right corner blocks
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> nice, now let's move to the left side
<Architect> so to the left of that blue column, make a 1x3 orange column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great, thanks
<Builder> yea no problem
<Architect> okay so in this view, we'll make a 2x1 layer of green that's connecting the 2 orange columns
<Builder> is it floating
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> nope
<Architect> great so then on the bottom of that green, make another 2x1
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> sorry, other isde
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> great, now do another one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> one more
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> okay so then get rid of the the 2x1 layer that's directly toucing the orange columns
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> great so then on the 2nd row, put another layer of 2x1 green
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> okay so now get rid of the 2nd layer that's farthest away from you
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and now on the row closest to you, put a 2x1 layer of yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> and that should be it!
<Builder> yay
