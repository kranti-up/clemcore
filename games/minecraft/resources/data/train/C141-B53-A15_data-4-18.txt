<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one's just a mess of blocks, so it might be annoying to build :(
<Builder> That's okay, we'll get it done!
<Architect> alright, make a stack of 6 yellow blocks in the center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> and remove the bottom one
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> next to the middle 3 blocks, make another stack of 3 yellow blocks
<Architect> so they should be floating
<Builder> Which side? Both?
<Architect> just one side, doesn't matter which :)
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> good! on the opposite side, make a stack of two yellow blocks on the ground
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> and one more yellow block on the ground next to it, in the same plane as the others
<Builder> To the left, right?
<Architect> yep!
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> okay, on the ground, on the side of the original stack of yellow blocks, put a blue block on the ground
<Architect> that wasn't clear
<Builder> Yeah I don't understand
<Architect> put a blue block on the ground perpendicular to the current blocks, but directly in front of the structure
<Builder> Oh I see
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> There?
<Builder> Cool
<Architect> another blue block on top of it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and then another on the ground on the side closest to you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect! remove the bottom blue block in the stack of 2
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> Should I build the same thing on the other side?
<Architect> yes, exactly that :)
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> okay, on the sides of the top of the floating stack of 3 yellow blocks, put one purple block each
<Builder> On the sides of the top block?
<Architect> the top yellow block on the stack that is 3 high, yes
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> okay, brace yourself
<Builder> I am braced
<Architect> move so where the yellow block is in front of you and the purple ones are on your sides
<Architect> so to your right
<Builder> Ok got it
<Architect> okay. you want a purple block one tile to the left, above, and towards you diagonally from the leftmost purple block
<Builder> I think I know what you want. Let me try
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect! nice work :)
<Architect> okay, another purple block in the same orientation on the other side, except it will be diagonally away from you
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
<Builder> Done
<Architect> nice! alright, one red block on top of the highest yellow block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
<Architect> and one in front of it, on the opposite side of the purple ones
<Architect> so above the yellow stack of 2
<Builder> Ah okay
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]
<Architect> and remove the first red block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
<Builder> There we go
<Architect> okay, i think that's it
<Builder> You could have just told me to build a banana man
<Architect> haha, next time :)
