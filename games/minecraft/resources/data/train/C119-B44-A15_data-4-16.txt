<Architect> perfect! extend those staircases in the other direction by two blocks on each side, so on top of the purple square
<Builder> I'm confused
<Architect> my bad D: so, get on top of the structure
<Architect> place a blue block on top of the purple blocks on the sides

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> like that, but without the backmost two blue blocks on each side

<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now, put a green block on top of the second highest blue stair on either side
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> and extend those one more green block on either side, so they're above the 3rd highest blue blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> and stack a green block on top of those last two
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> and remove the bottom two green blocks
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]

<Architect> perfect! sorry for the confusion
