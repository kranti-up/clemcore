<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one's like a butterfly when you look at it form the top
<Builder> ok, thanks
<Architect> but it's going to be built in the air
<Builder> so all on one horizontal plane, but floating?
<Architect> not quite all in one horizontal plane but more or less
<Builder> ok.
<Architect> the first purple block is going to be closer to your side of the box and about cells up?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
