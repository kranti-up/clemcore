<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay. We are going to make a red capital A in the center of the map.
<Architect> It is three blocks wide, and four blocks high
<Architect> So first put two red blocks, separated by a space, in the center of the map
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Then three more red blocks on top of each of those
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Then connect the top blocks and the blocks one space above the bottom with red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Now make a column of four yellow blocks on the right side of the A, touching the side of it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Okay, now on the side behind the A from where you are, make a "loop" of yellow blocks that is three blocks high, connected to the yellow column
<Architect> So the yellow will make a lowercase b
<Builder> A loop up or down?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> Like that?
<Architect> Yes that's right, but needs to be rotated so it's perpendicular to the A and behind it
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> Perfect
<Builder> This way?
<Architect> Okay now make a column of four blue blocks on the side of the b that is not touching the red A
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Builder> This side?
<Architect> Yes perfect
<Architect> Now build out rows of two blocks on the top and bottom of that column, so they are parallel to the A
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> Great. Now make a column of four purple blocks next to the red A, on the front face of the A, on the right.
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> We're going to make a lowercase d that closes the cube.
<Builder> This side?
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Other side
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> Yes perfect. Now a loop three blocks high on the bottom
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> Great! We're done
