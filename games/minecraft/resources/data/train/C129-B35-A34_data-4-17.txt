<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> oh no
<Architect> this is tough
<Builder> what is the shape
<Architect> its kinda like the 3 rings interlocking with each other thing
<Builder> what colors are usesd
<Architect> blue, purple, and red
<Builder> are the rings 3x3 or 5x5?
<Architect> neither
<Architect> its kinda odd
<Architect> but start with blue
<Architect> and place one blue block one off from the center

<Architect> now look at it
<Architect> stay at that perspective
<Architect> so stay on that side
<Builder> is this the reference u want me to keep
<Builder> okay
<Architect> you want to build a V shape

<Builder> this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now use purple and replicate that on top using symmetry
<Builder> is it a reflection?
<Architect> yes, reflection

<Architect> ok so those are the 2 rings
<Builder> okay
<Architect> the last ring is red in colour and its a 5x5 hollow square
<Builder> is it perpindicular to these 2 rings
<Architect> perpendicular
