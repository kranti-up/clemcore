<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> We'll start with a 2x2 square of red bricks

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Then one layer up, we'll add the perimeter of a 4x4 orange square

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Then on the 4th layer, we'll have another 2x2 square of purple bricks
<Builder> whoops
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> haha no worries
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> The purple layer will be one layer higher
<Builder> oh yes, sorry
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> No problem
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Now floating above the the back right corner of the purple square, add another purple brick
<Architect> So there will be a space between this brick and the purple square
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Cool Now behind the brick (relative to your perspective, add another purple brick
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! Now add another brick on top of that one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> So if you look at the 6th layer of the structure (the one that currently has two bricks)
<Architect> We are going to make it into a plus sign
<Architect> where the middle brick of the plus is the one directly underneat the brick you just added
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> That's perfect!
