<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, so this one is a little odd i think
<Builder> no problem, if it's hard to describe we can just go step by step
<Architect> so start by building an upright rectangle that is two block long and then 4 blocks high
<Architect> it should be blue

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> great!
<Architect> now remove the bottom block on the righ t

<Architect> and then both of the blocks on the second level
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]

<Architect> okay, i messed up a bit. build an additoional row at the top
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> everything is in blue btw
<Builder> okay cool
<Builder> is this good so far?
<Architect> yep. doing great!
<Architect> now we just have to remove the left block on the 2nd row from the top
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
