<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this is tetris
<Architect> all in 2D
<Builder> on the plane?
<Architect> no it is vertical
<Builder> or into the air?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so maybe like 2 blocks away from the edge, place a tower of 4 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> the next piece is a RED L
<Architect> on the ground, place a row of 3 red blocks
<Builder> adjacent to the blue?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> and now the last red block is on the second level adjacent to the blue
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> next is an orange zig zag piece
<Architect> place 2 orange blocks above the last red piece you placed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> the other one
<Architect> the one that is closest to the blue
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> and the last 2 are vertical on the red block in the middle
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> great
<Architect> next is a green zig zag piece
<Architect> place 2 on the ground in line with the red
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and place 2 one layer above adjacent to the orange
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> ok great
<Architect> the last one is a purple T piece that is not connected to this figure at all
<Architect> the T is sideways so it looks liek "-|"
<Architect> keep 2 blocks of space above that last green block and place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> place one to the right of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> and one above and below that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> yeha that looks good
<Builder> yeehaw
