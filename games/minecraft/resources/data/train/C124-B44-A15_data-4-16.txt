<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> ready
<Architect> okay, this one may take a bit. start by making a row of 4 yellow blocks on the ground, starting in the very center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> which direction do youw ant the row
<Architect> and from the centermost yellow block, make another row of 4 perpendicular
<Architect> any direction! it will ultimately be an L shape parallel to the ground
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> and connect the endmost yellow blocks to make a triangle
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> sorry, one more space inwards
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect! now, stack another layer of yellow blocks on top of that, then remove the bottom layer
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> so it's the same structure, but one tile off the ground
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> okay, now, using the innermost corner of the triangle, make a 2x2 square of red blocks
<Architect> but leave the yellow corner as is
<Architect> whoops, sorry
<Architect> okay, move to the corner of the L
<Architect> and place a red block on both remaining sides of the corner
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah like that. sorry, didn't know how to phrase it
<Architect> and connect those blocks with one more red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> okay, now, hop off the structure to your righthand side
<Architect> and extend the closest row of red blocks to you to a row of 5 red blocks
<Architect> to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4]
<Architect> perfect! now, put another red block in front of the 2nd rightmost one, so the red structure is symmetrical
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> other side, sorry
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> and one more red block to make a triangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> great!
<Architect> now, place a blue block under that last red one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and directly to the left and to the right of that last red one, place another blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> and then a row of 5 blue blocks on top of those two, to make another triangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> whoops, hold on
<Architect> okay, make a row of 7 red blocks next to the current row of 5, so it's a bigger triangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:5]
<Architect> and remove the innermost three red blocks on the row of 5, so it's hollow
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> alright, perfect! my bad
<Architect> looks good now :)
<Builder> nice
