<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> :)
<Architect> This one is a little difficult, we will be building some large numbers
<Builder> like the block I but it's a number
<Builder> how many digits?
<Architect> Right
<Architect> First we will make a 2
<Builder> and what color(s)
<Architect> The 2 will be green
<Architect> In the middle, make a row of three green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> should I move that?
<Architect> The placement is fine, but switch to the other side
<Builder> shift it?
<Architect> Good
<Architect> Now on the left block, build two more green blocks upward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Two green blocks to the right, off the top green block
<Builder> this is going to be like a HEX 2?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> Yeah, the top part of the 2 now.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Now go to the lower righthand corner of the two
<Architect> Behind the right-most green block, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> there?
<Builder> that's behind
<Architect> Yes, that's good
<Builder> gr8
<Architect> Now moving right, place two more purple blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> This one will be an 8
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> same height?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> Correct, same height
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> That's good
<Architect> Now come to the side of the 8 so the 2 is behind the 8
<Architect> Go to the bottom righthand corner of the 8
<Architect> Place a yellow block diagonal to the corner of the 8
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> Yes
<Architect> Now two more yellow blocks to the right of that
<Builder> alright. What number is this?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> 6
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Nice, that's perfect
<Architect> Now go to the bottom right corner of the 6
<Architect> I'm sorry, bottom left corner. My mistake
<Builder> you good
<Architect> Place an orange block right infront of that yellow block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Good, now make it a tower the same heigh as the other numbers
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> Nice, it will be a 7. So we just need two more orange blocks off the left side of the tower
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> Fantastic. Let me just double check this
<Builder> just a bunch of colorful numbers
<Architect> Looks fine to me, good job
