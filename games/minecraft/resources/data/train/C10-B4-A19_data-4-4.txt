<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some yellow blocks
<Architect> in the center of the row, there's a floating block with z=1
<Architect> like in the xyz coordinate plane
<Builder> center of which row?
<Architect> we only need one entire row for this
<Architect> so it doesn't matter which row
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah now place two on the sides except they're on the ground, z = 0
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> ok so now two units from each yellow block on the ground, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> now place two purple blocks like before, except two units away from the yellow floating block
<Architect> meaning z =1
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4]
<Builder> on top of the other purples?
<Architect> uh no right next to the ones you just placed, one horizontal space
<Builder> so connecting the purple and yellow diagonally?
<Architect> yea
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah like that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> then 3 purple stacked horizontally on top of the yellow floating block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> the on the very ends place red blocks
<Architect> the row ends
<Builder> of which row?
<Architect> the same row
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> oh sorry i meant on the ground
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> not conected to the other blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> so like the yellow and the purple stack diagonally
<Architect> stack the red ones diagonally in the air
<Builder> okay how many?
<Architect> till z = 4
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah like that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> then place 3 red ones directly on top ot the purple ones directly on top
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> ok we're done
<Builder> nice
