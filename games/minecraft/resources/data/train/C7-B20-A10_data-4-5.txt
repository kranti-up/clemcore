<Architect> put a row of three orange blocks down
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> orange again on top of either end
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> then a row of seven on top of that, but starting from the left of this structure
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]

<Architect> yep!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-3]

<Architect> oh sorry the right

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> and remove the inner corner of the square you just built
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> so the bottom left of the one you just built
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> yeah! now going up, you're making a v of red blocks.
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> so put a red block on top in the center. and put reds on each edge, in the same plane as teh orange blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3]

<Builder> up one? or there?
<Architect> building upward. so yes, up one.
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> and then repeat that outward twice more
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:-3]
<Architect> yep!
