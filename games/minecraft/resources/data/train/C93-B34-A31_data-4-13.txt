<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Back to basics, this one looks easy
<Builder> nice
<Architect> In the middle, build a tower of red blocks three high
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> To the right of the bottom block, place another red block so it makes an 'L' shape
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Nice. Behind that red block, build a tower of yellow blocks three high
<Builder> I think we are getting the hang of this
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Most definitely, this is running very smoothly
<Architect> Now look so the yellow is in front of the red
<Architect> Make an upside-down 'L' out of yellow
<Builder> so do I put one on the left or the right?
<Architect> Sorry, on the right. It will connect to the red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Great, let me just double check
<Architect> Cool, looks all good to me
<Builder> neat
