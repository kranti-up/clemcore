[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> and delete the first yellow block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> okay, now, make a row of 4 yellow blocks, with 1-space gaps in between, towards you
<Architect> so perpendicular to the green blocks :)
<Builder> where's the starting point for the row
<Architect> the first yellow block, sorry
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]

<Architect> looks good! it only needs 4 blocks though, so delete that last one

<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now, on top of the 2nd closest yellow block to the green ones, put an orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> and make a 1-gap row of three orange blocks, perpendicular to the green ones
<Architect> on the side you're currently on
<Architect> yeah, that side
<Builder> on top of the yellow blocks?
<Architect> no, parallel to the green ones
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah like that!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now put a red block right next to the last orange one, in the same direction
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> put another red one on top of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> and three more below it so it touches the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> now remove the 2nd block from the bottom
<Architect> and the 2nd from the top
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> so it's also 1-gap
<Architect> i think it's good! :)
<Builder> sweet!
