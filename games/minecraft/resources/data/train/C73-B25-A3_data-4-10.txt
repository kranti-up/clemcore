<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this looks like someone tried to spell with blocks and failed
<Builder> LOL
<Builder> aight
<Builder> dimensions?
<Builder> WxLxH
<Builder> just so we develop a convention
<Architect> anyway all the letters go straight up so we just need to start at one side and go across. i'd say like 11x1x4
<Builder> kk
<Architect> lets start at the left. we need placeholder blocks to get it off the ground so use red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> ok put 1 purple block on top of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then a red to the right of it
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> that works too. put 1 purple block to the right of the top red block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> my bad i misread that, but that still works?
<Architect> yeah. and 1 purple block on top of the top red block too
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah that works. we will remove red later
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> so this purple is kind of like an x if that helps. we need to put purple blocks in the top right and lower right of that center purple block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah buddy
<Architect> now you can remove placeholders. the letters aren't connected
<Builder> k
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> ok next is yellow. it is also off the ground. place 2 reds on the ground 1 space awaay from the purple
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> i mean two reds side by side, then you can place 2 yellows on top of each
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> gotchu
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> nice. then put 2 more reds on top of the yellow and 2 yellows on top of the new reds
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> yup like that
<Architect> last is a green y shape. this one starts on the ground
<Architect> place 3 green blocks 1 space away from the yellows flat on the ground
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> then 3 on top of the rightmost green block so its upright
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah like that
