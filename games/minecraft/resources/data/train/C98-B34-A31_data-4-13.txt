<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> how complex?
<Architect> Some of these objects will be floating
<Builder> is there any oclor we are not using>
<Architect> This first one we make will not be. This one will be built on the ground
<Architect> No, we will be using all six colors. We will use yellow first. After we finish this first one, we can use yellow as the 'delete' blockss
<Builder> ok
<Architect> So we will need yellow first. One block away from an edge, put a yellow block near the center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> There ya go, that's good
<Architect> Moving toward the center, place three more yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> On either side of the third yellow block, place another yellow so it looks like a cross
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> no more yellow will be needed
<Builder> ok
<Builder> very religious
<Architect> Using green, place two blocks diagonal from the top yellow block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> ??
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> There will be two other shapes like this, but they will be floating
<Builder> exactly the same?
<Architect> yes, just oriented differently and using different colors
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Place a yellow block diagonal to the left green block
<Builder> on which side?
<Architect> top left diagonal of the left green block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Place a red block on top
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> You can delete the yellow
<Architect> Now two reds to the right of the current red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> I apologize, to the left of the curent red
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Perfect, now make a cross in the same direction of the yellow one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> The green blocks will be orange for this one
<Builder> what color are the ear things?
<Architect> They will also be floating
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> Perfect, now move to the top right corner of the white base
<Architect> Right on the edge, in line with the orange ears, place a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like that
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> On top, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> Purple will be thecross
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> And blue ears
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> I made a mistake, the whole purple and blue figure should be one block to the left, toward the red one
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> yep, you got it
<Builder> great
<Architect> And let me just double check these
<Architect> Nice
