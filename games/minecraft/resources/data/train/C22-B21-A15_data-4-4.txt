<Architect> okay, cool!
<Architect> so we're building a smiley face
<Architect> you're gonna want to put a single blue block down near the middle of the grid
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> then another blue block 3 spaces away in any direction
<Builder> is there good
<Architect> yep!
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, now put an orange block three spaces in front of the blue block, on the opposite side you're standing on now
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> good!
<Architect> now complete the square you're making with a red block

<Architect> cool!
<Architect> from your current position, put a purple block down one space forward and to the right of the red block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
