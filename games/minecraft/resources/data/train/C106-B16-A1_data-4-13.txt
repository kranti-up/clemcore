[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> can you add it a little more to the center
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> good
<Architect> now on the other side the branch goes up two more red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> sorry these are not steps

[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> yes like that
<Architect> now like the other side add one red step followed by a green step
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]

<Architect> okay time to add more leaves
<Architect> on the bottom on the last red step you placed add two green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> almost it should be touching the red branch
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> great
<Architect> now add three more green all parallel to the ground
<Architect> making a box
<Architect> or square
<Architect> and using the last green block you placed as one of the corners
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> almost it should be a square
<Architect> so 2x2
<Builder> ahh okay
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> instead of 4x1

[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> got it
<Architect> now we only need two more green blocks
