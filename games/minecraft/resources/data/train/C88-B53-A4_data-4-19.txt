<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is a little more abstract
<Builder> I'm ready
<Architect> start with blue
<Architect> you're making a sort of tilted M
<Architect> go toward one edge
<Architect> and build a floating column of 2
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> One block up?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now one to the right
<Builder> one what? column?
<Architect> one block to the right of your top block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> now one above that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one to the right of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> now you'll make this same structure again
<Architect> look at the shadow of this shape
<Architect> the shadow of the next one starts to the right two and back one
<Builder> Okay I think I understand, let me try
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> good, but it's to the right two of the edge of the first shadow
<Builder> Alright, I'll fix it
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> the right edge
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here, yes?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> one toward you
<Builder> Just kidding, here
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> yep
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> great. nicely done
<Architect> now an orange square
<Architect> the edges of its shadow align with the right edge of the first and left of the second
<Architect> it's a vertical 3x3
<Architect> it's two blank spaces away from the second structure on the opposite side of you
