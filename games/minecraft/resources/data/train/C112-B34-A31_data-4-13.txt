<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> This is abstract and very colorful
<Architect> We will start with blue
<Builder> great
<Architect> Go to one of the edges of the white base
<Architect> One block from the edge, place a blue block near the middle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice, now one more blue block on the backside of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> And then two more blue blocks on top of the back-most blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Yes, now we will use green
<Architect> On the left side of the top-most blue block, place two green blockws
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> in a row like that?
<Architect> Yep, like that
<Architect> Now use green blocks to connect it to the ground. You should only need 2 green blocks to do that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> this is funky
<Architect> Lol, now move so the green portion is in front of the blue
<Architect> On the ground, place two green blocks moving to the left of the bottom green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> um
<Architect> yeah, that's right
<Architect> Now two green blocks moving backwards from the left-most green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> snek
<Architect> Great, now we will use yellow blocks
<Architect> On top of the green block farthest away from you, stack two yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Now two yellow blocks coming toward you from the top yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> is this like a spiral of sorts?
<Architect> yes, exactly like a spiral
<Architect> Two yellow blocks to the left of the last one you placed
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> And one yellow block moving down from that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> Nice, we will use orange now
<Builder> alright
<Builder> do I put one under the yellow?
<Architect> Yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Then two behind it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> And two up
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> One to the left
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Awesome, now we will use red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Two red blocks coming forward from that red one
<Builder> two in front now
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> down?
<Architect> Down
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> And back
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Nicee
<Architect> Let me just double check it
<Builder> abstract art
<Architect> good thing I double-checked, we need one more red block going left off the last one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> I think we are good
<Builder> though I dont really know
<Architect> Looks good to me
