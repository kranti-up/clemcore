<Architect> now on the middle red most block add three red blocks going towards you
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> great now delete the first two blocks you just added
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
