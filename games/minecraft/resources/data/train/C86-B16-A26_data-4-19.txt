<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> This structure looks fun- nothing will touch the ground!
<Builder> cool!
<Architect> We'll start with a row of 4 purple bricks, a layer above the ground

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! now to the left and right of one of the purple bricks in the middle of the row, add orange bricks
<Architect> Sort of like a floating cross if you viewed it from the sky

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> Great! we'll add a two blue bricks, one space away from the orange bricks and diagonally adjacent to the top of the cross
<Architect> You could think of it as adding a row of blue bricks to the top of the cross and then removing the middle brick
<Builder> in the same layer as the rest of the structure?
<Architect> Yes!

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> We'll do that once more (so the blue bricks are part of a length 2 blue diagonal
<Architect> )

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> great! Now we'll mve up a layer
<Architect> we'll start by making the perimeter of a 3x5 orange rectangle
<Architect> the corners of the rectangle touch the orange bricks onthe second layer

<Architect> The three bricks you added will be the center of the rectangle

<Architect> You're close! try rotating the rectangle 90 degrees

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> so if you looked down from the sky, through the rectangle, you would see the orange-purple-orange part of the seoncd layer
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> maybe an easier way to put it is to add a brick on top of the brick at the top of the cross
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> Sorry! The other side of the purple row

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> Ok! That brick will be part of a row of length 5, perpendicular to the purple row

<Architect> Can you remove the two orange bricks from the middle
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! Now we'll add the perimeter of a 7x5 rectangle on top of the 3x5 one (up a layer)
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> Also orange

<Architect> The row you're currently building will be the side that has length 7
<Builder> unless i am reading your directions badly, it doesnt seem like we have enough orange to build this?
<Architect> Ok! we'll need to remove some bricks from the second layer anyway, so we might as well do that now!
<Builder> if we are removing parts of this, we can substitute some for purple
<Builder> alright!
<Architect> Please remove the bricks from the 3x5 rectangle that are not the corner bricks

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> And for the 7x5 rectangle, we will only need the sides of length 5
<Architect> not the entire rectangle
<Builder> alright!

<Architect> I think the row on you're right needs to be moved to the right by one space
<Architect> So that it is symmetrical to the left side of the structure
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
<Builder> okay i see!
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> Ok!

<Builder> there we go!
