<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> alright, start with two blue blocks near the center, with a 3-tile gap in between
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> so they're the endpoints of a line of 5
<Architect> okay, now put 3 more blue blocks between those so they make a vertically-oriented triangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and off of each of the endmost blocks, make a staircase of blue blocks, so the end shape is a vertically-oriented "W"
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> the W is 3-blocks high total

<Architect> perfect! now, you're going to build that exact same structure on top of the blue blocks, but upside down
<Architect> and purple
