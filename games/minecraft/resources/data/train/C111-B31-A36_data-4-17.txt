[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> then repeat the same for another layer
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> then delete the blocks from the bottom so that it's floating
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
