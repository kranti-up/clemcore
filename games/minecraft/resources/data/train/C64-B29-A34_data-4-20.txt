[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> now place 3 orange blocks above that keeping symmetry
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]

<Architect> place one orange block on the 2 orange blokcs on the right side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> and one last orange block on the orange on the very right
