<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hmm, another one i can't really describe
<Architect> but this one is all on same plane, standing up
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> also, it takes up the whole width of the board
<Architect> so let's start on the left
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> make a 2x2 yellow square standing up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> now, make a red 2x3 rectangle such that the top right block of the square is left of the bottom left block of the rectangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> 2x3 longside on the ground?
<Architect> short side on the ground
<Builder> or shortside on the ground?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> cool
<Architect> we're going to make another yellow square to the left of the rectangle, but this time only the corners will touch
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> now make a row of 3 orange blocks extending out the right side of the botom and top blocks of the red rectangle
<Architect> bottom*
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> uhh so remember how i said that this is all going to be on the same plane
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah :D
<Builder> sorry about that lol I forgot
<Architect> haha no problem
<Architect> the rest of the structure just mirrors the left side (if you took the middle orange blocks to be center)
<Builder> gotcha
