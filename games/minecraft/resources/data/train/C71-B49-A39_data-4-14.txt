<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again :)
<Builder> ready player one
<Architect> this one looks annoying
<Architect> it's a bunch of dotted lines
<Architect> going from one edge to the other, make a floating row of green blocks, except that they have one-block gaps in between them
<Architect> it will have 5 blocks total

<Architect> no, i don't think it matters, as long as there are 5
<Architect> though i need to make sure we left enough space for everything else, one sec
<Architect> we're maybe okay
<Builder> if you say so
<Architect> can you position yourself so that you're at the end of that line, but with the larger amount of blank space to your right?
<Architect> wait jk, you put it in the middle
<Architect> let's shift it all over so that they're three blocks away from the left edge
