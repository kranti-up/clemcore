<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello! this one's pretty easy
<Architect> put a row of 3 blue blocks on the ground anywhere
<Builder> That does sound easy
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and then on one side, stack two more blue blocks
<Architect> so you have an "L" shape
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> Ok, like this?
<Architect> perfect! all done
<Builder> Cool
