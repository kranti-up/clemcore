<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> ready
<Architect> We will start on the ground, placing red-purple-yellow-yellow-purple-red in a line. Each will have a space in between

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Close, I think on your right it should be yellow-purple-red instead of purple-green
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Now in the center there should be two yellows, not just one
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> So t6 bricks in total
