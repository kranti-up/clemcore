<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hi! I think we should start by adding the corners of a purple 5x5 square
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> The corners will be part of columns of height 2
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> Oops, I think you have too many spaces between the corners

<Architect> On the layer beneath the red square, we'll also add a 3x3 perimeter of a square of orange bricks
<Architect> Does that make sense?
<Builder> yep!
<Architect> Great!

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> Good stuff! Now in the middle of the bottom layer, add a yellow brick
<Architect> We made some kind of mix of concentric squares and a table
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> I think the yellow brick should be touching the ground
<Builder> oh okay!
<Architect> Sorry, I didn't clarify that
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]

<Architect> Perfect!
