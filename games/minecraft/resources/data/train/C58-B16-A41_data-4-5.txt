<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay. Put down a line of five blue blocks close a few square away from the corner of the environment.
<Builder> here? the outlined area?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Sorry, typo lol. Yeah that's good. Parallel to the edge of the environment
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Okay. Now two yellow blocks, parallel to the blue blocks. on the side closest to you and closest to the edge of the environment.
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> Should be on the left side, sorry.
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> cool. Now one more yellow block to the left of those two
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Perfect. Now a row of two yellow blocks, one on top of the yellow block that's sticking out, and one next to that one.
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yep perfect
<Architect> now delete the yellow block on the bottom, closest to the edge of the environment
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> cool. now fill in the rest of that row with three blue blocks on the ground, parallel to the other blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great!
<Builder> sorry, that took a minute!
<Architect> Yeah sorry my instruction was ambiguous haha
<Architect> Okay, now adjacent to the middle blue block that you just laid down
<Architect> You are going to build the same yellow structure that you did before
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> It will be perpendicular to the other yellow structure
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> And the dangling part faces away from the blue blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Okay now fill in blue blocks on the ground so that the blocks on the ground form a rectangle. It will be 4 blocks by 5 blocks.

<Architect> So fill in the space between the two yellow shapes first
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Fill in that gap with blue
<Builder> I can't? It doesn't seem like there is anymore blue. Do I remove a portion already built?
<Architect> Oh yeah. Remove the rows that go underneath the dangling yellow parts

<Architect> Okay great
<Builder> That was rough, sorry
<Architect> Now just fill in two blocks next to the yellow thing
<Architect> So the whole base forms a rectangle
<Architect> No worries, this is a weird one
