<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> You can start this one somewhat in the center, but it goes mostly upwards. Place a red block first
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Sorry I meant orange. It looked more like red at first!
<Builder> np
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Now place one diagonally below it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! Now place another one diagonal to the first one, on the right
<Builder> again below it right?
<Architect> Yup!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great. Now place an orange block in the middle of those two blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> And then place one right below the one you just placed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> you could've said a plus sign ;)
<Architect> Great, now stack an orange block on top of the center one
<Builder> but no problem
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Haha I didn't realize there was a center block until she pointed it out
<Architect> You can't really see it here
<Builder> ah i see!
<Builder> true
<Architect> Okay now put another orange block on top of that
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> We're going to build a square around this block using green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, great!
<Architect> now place another orange block on top of the center one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Sorry place another orange block on top of this one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> another square around this one?
<Architect> Great, now we're going to make a plus sign with green blocks
<Architect> plus sign this time!
<Builder> cool
<Builder> center of the plus on top of the last orange block i placed?
<Architect> The orange block is the center sorry
<Builder> ah got it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> or is the plus bigger?
<Architect> Yes perfect! now stack two yellow blocks on top of the orange one in the center, but remove the first one so there's just one floating on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> Awesome! Ok there are a few random blocks left to place here and there
<Architect> There is a red block jutting out on the left side next to the orange block standing by itself
<Builder> which orange block?
<Architect> I think it's the third one from down
<Architect> wait fourth one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Yes except it's right next to that one. So place another one to the left and then remove this one
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> ya that's why i was a bit confused
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah sorry! Ok now we're going to do the same thing with a purple block
<Builder> np
<Architect> Place one above the orange block on the right side of the plus sign at the bottom
<Architect> You're standing in the right spot
<Builder> ya not sure which place you mean
<Architect> Sorry so the base of the structure is a plus right. Place a purple block on top of the right orange block of the plus sign
<Architect> Stack it, I mean
<Builder> right orange block of the pus sign?
<Builder> plus*
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> you mean here?
<Architect> No you have to go all the way to the bottom
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> oh this plus sign!!
<Builder> i thought the green one!
<Builder> lol
<Builder> forgot there were two plus signs
<Architect> No worries!
<Builder> ya that's why i didn't understand when you said base of the structure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah sorry i may have forgotton to say orange plus
<Architect> yes. Now place a purple one to the right of this one and then remove this one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! now go the left side of the plus sign.
<Architect> And place a blue block two squares above the one directly next to the orange block
<Architect> sorry that was confusing
<Builder> haha
<Builder> np
<Architect> so on the left side of the plus, instead of placing the blue block directly next to the orange one, place it two squares above,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> I don't know if that helps either lol
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> not sure if that's right
<Architect> It has to be down next to the base structure
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> like on the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yes that's right, but it's on the wrong side sorry. We want it on the side opposite the random purple block
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> so this side...
<Architect> yes
<Builder> now two squares above which block exactly?
<Architect> So maybe it's easier if I tell you to place it somewhere first and then move it. Place it on the ground next to the orange block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Yes now move it to the left by two squares
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes, great! now place another blue block on top of it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> phew :)
<Architect> Now remove the bottom blue one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and we're done! phew
<Builder> haha
<Builder> cool
