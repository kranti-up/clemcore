<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hola
<Architect> hello
<Architect> we're going to build a flower
<Builder> yay!
<Architect> but it has a pretty complex shape
<Builder> less yay
<Architect> beginning with the stem in green
<Architect> start in the middle so we have some room
<Architect> the stem is 4 tall but the bottom block is shifted out by one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> precisely
<Architect> now a purple block symmetric to the bottom green block
<Architect> on top
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> oh wair
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> up top
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]

<Architect> great
<Builder> sorry about that
<Architect> no worries, you're still being programmed
<Builder> so true
<Architect> now for the rest of the flower
<Architect> we're are going to make a 3 by 3 square with the purple block as its center
<Architect> but shifted one block away
<Architect> from the purple block
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Builder> not entirely

<Architect> one block out
<Architect> in yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4]
