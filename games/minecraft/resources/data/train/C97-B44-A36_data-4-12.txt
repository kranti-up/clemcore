<Builder> I'm confused. I went to the red block and placed a red block behind it. what am I doing wrong?
<Architect> you placed a red block in front of it not behind
<Builder> the red block is behind the first red block from my perspective. I think it would be easier if you gave me instructions from my point of view

<Architect> ok then place another red block behind that
