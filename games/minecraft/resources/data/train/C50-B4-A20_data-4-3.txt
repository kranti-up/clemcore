<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> leave room for a 7x7 structure
<Architect> we'll start with the easiest
<Architect> purple
<Architect> this one floats in the air one block above the ground
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> actually move it one block inwards

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> good description
<Architect> thank you
<Architect> now switch to yello
<Architect> it also floats
<Architect> the top of yellow lines up with the top of purple
<Builder> how close to the purple structure?
<Architect> it starts one block under purple (to your left)
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> ?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> no sorry
<Architect> it's in the same line as the purple
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> scoot it over one block so there's a space between
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now build two up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> knock down the bottom two
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> make a line
<Architect> same as you did for purple
<Architect> like same direction
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> knock out the middle
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> we're going to move to building on the opposite side you're on
<Architect> so other side of the purple and yellow
<Architect> still attached to the yellow
<Architect> so right at the edge
<Architect> in line with the two yellow you already made
<Architect> floating one block above the ground
<Architect> other edge sorry
<Architect> you'll place two blocks similar to the ones floating in the air
<Builder> which yellow block?
<Builder> i'll place one and you can tell me how to shift it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> alrighty
<Architect> if you moved that two forward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3]
