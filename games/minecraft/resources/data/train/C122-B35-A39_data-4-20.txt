<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this one looks like a little bird standing up, sort of
<Builder> okay
<Architect> let's start with the feet
<Architect> first, make an upside-down T shape in blue blocks
<Builder> how high?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> that's high enough
<Architect> oh wait
<Architect> remove the last one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> cool, now make the same shape parallel to it, one space away and aligned with it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> done
<Architect> next, a 3x3 orange square sits on top of these and is centered
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> done
<Architect> now we'll make small wings
<Architect> on one side aligned with either foot, we need blocks coming out diagonally and up from that side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> how many?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> it's just one for now
<Architect> it's a very small wing
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4]
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> yeah!
<Builder> cool
<Builder> same thing on other side?
<Architect> behind that one put an orange, and in front of it put a red
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> then you can do the same thing on the other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> done
<Architect> cool
<Architect> last thing is a yellow head
<Architect> it will be coming off the square from the other side
<Architect> on top of the middle orange block on that side of the square, put a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one more hanging off the side
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool, i think that's it, let me check
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> all good
<Architect> nice work
<Builder> thanks! you too
