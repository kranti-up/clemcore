<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> its a science experiment table...
<Architect> lets start with red
<Architect> place four blocks at the corner of a 3x6 flat on the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> add one more red on top of these
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> now the table top is yellow
<Architect> make the 3x6
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> we will build on top of this table now
<Architect> place one blue block, one block left of the edge and on the side closest to you
<Builder> is it floating?
<Architect> its one the table
<Architect> on*
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> its next to that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> great
<Architect> now on the second corner closest to this blue block place a green block
<Builder> this corner?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> thats the first closest corner
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> yes there
<Architect> now make a step with a green block towards the right from where you are
<Architect> add a green step
<Builder> off of the blue?
<Architect> of the last block you placed, green
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> place two purple blocks one he middle of the table
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> good now delete the one closest to the blue
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> place a purple block on top of this one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> good now add a puple block going towards you
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> another puple going away from the blue and green, attached to the second purple block you added
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> not that one the one before it
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> good
<Architect> add one orange block at the corner farthest from the blue
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> good
<Architect> okay, one more orange block and we are done,
<Architect> its not above the table
<Architect> though it a diagonal step connected to the last orange block you placed
<Architect> its*
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> yeah thats it
