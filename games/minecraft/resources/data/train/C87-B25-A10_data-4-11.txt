<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
<Builder> what color
<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that or on the ground?
<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)

[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay. now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that.
<Architect> you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground

<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yea
<Builder> is this the stack overflow logo
<Architect> idk i haven't seen it
<Builder> oh ok, is that it?
<Architect> yee
