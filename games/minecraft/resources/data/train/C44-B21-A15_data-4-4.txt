<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ready?
<Builder> yup
<Architect> cool!
<Architect> this one looks a little more complex
<Architect> so you're going to want to start by making a row of 4 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> now, on each of the two end blocks, put another blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> then make another row of blue blocks on top of those, so it's a hollow rectangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, now on the side you're standing on now, place a purple block in front of both of the top corners of the structure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yep! :)
<Architect> then diagonally in front of those blocks, put two more purple blocks, so they make an arc shape
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> alright, now move over to the other side of the structure
<Architect> you'll want a yellow block in front of the topright blue block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> and on the opposite side, put a green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep! now, put another green block one cell above and in front of the current one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> good!
<Architect> this is hard to describe
<Architect> you'll want another yellow block above, in front of, and to the right of the current one
<Architect> from the perspective of where you currenrtly are
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now place one more yellow block in that exact same trajectory
<Architect> so that its corners touch the highest yellow and green blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> whoops, sorry, that was unclear
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd yellow blocks should all be in a diagonal line :)
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect! :)
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> oh wait
<Architect> yeah now it's good, sorry D:
<Builder> cool!
