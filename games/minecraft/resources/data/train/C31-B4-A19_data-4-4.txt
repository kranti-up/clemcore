<Architect> and they're floating
<Architect> so get some blue blocks
<Architect> so one square from the edge
<Architect> and three units up
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah so each letter is basically a 3 by 3 square with some squares missing
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> and they start one unit up, not two units up
<Builder> there's only one blank space underneath?
<Architect> so basically just move that one down one row
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> yeah sory

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yea
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> make an O
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> good?
<Architect> uh so this is actually the mirror image of the actual mission
<Architect> so the H should be behind the O
<Architect> from the direction you're facing
