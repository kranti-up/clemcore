<Architect> hello
<Architect> can you see this okay?
<Builder> hello!
<Builder> yes
<Architect> excellent!
<Architect> aparently, this first structure is a warm up
<Architect> it's just 3 blocks arranged in an L shape
<Builder> oh cool
<Architect> so two blocks next to each other on the ground
<Builder> any color?
<Architect> and then one more block on top of either
<Architect> they are blue!
<Architect> i didn't know color was important

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
