<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hello, do you have your blocks on hand?
<Builder> yeah
<Builder> how should we begin
<Architect> Ok, we are building something that is going to look like a 3x3 rectangle.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Can you make an elbow with 3 red blocks?
<Builder> vertical, horizantal?
<Builder> flat on the ground?
<Architect> Lying flat on the ground
<Architect> Yup
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Perfect, now just add a red block on top of the elbow's corner
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Sorry, can you shift the whole thing up by one block. I think the height matters.

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> height does matter
<Architect> Ok, to the right of that, can you make the same design, except upside down and in yellow?
<Builder> what direction
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Sort of, it should have the block nearest to you rest on the right block of the red one
<Builder> which red block?
<Architect> The red block just to the right of where you are looking

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> so like that?
<Architect> Sorry, can you rotate it 90 degrees, so that it is 3 blocks wide, and flush on the far side?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> how about this
<Builder> tell me one block at a time
<Builder> and what direction
<Architect> Ok, there should be a yellow block in the elbow you see on the left.
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> Yup,
<Builder> ok, now direct me using my perspective
<Builder> I wont move
<Builder> off of that yellow block, where should I build?
<Architect> Ok, can you add a yellow block to the left of that one
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> And one more beneath it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> And finally, on the other side. add another yellow block to the corner of the elbow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> Perfect, can you go to other side?
<Architect> Under the closest yellow block, can you put a green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> in front of and behind work as commands too
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> Can you add a green block to the green and yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Builder> like that?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> Yup, just like that
<Builder> what is the last color?
<Architect> Now we just need to use orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Builder> yes?
<Architect> Perfect
<Builder> great
