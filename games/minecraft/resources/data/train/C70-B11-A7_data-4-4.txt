<Architect> this one doesn't really look like anything, it's just super snakey
<Builder> ok. maybe back to coordinates?
<Architect> put a yellow block in one corner of the square
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> okay let's call that square the bottom left corner
<Builder> ok
<Architect> (0,0)
<Builder> does the whole thing stay on the ground/
<Builder> ?
<Architect> yellow blocks at (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1)
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> no unfortunately
<Architect> on the right most block put a yellow block on top of that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> and go right one more
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> now forward one
<Builder> i'll face the same way as much as possible so relative directions work well
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> and two more in the same direction
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> put two blocks on top of the last block you built
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> one right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> one up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> on right
<Architect> one right from the last thing you built
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> one up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> now build two towards you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> one to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> one up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3]
<Architect> one away from you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Builder> that's my last yellow
<Architect> now we're going to switch to green
<Builder> ready
<Architect> i think something might be wrong, give me a second to check
<Builder> ok.
<Architect> okay never mind it's fine
<Builder> great
<Architect> build one block right of the last block you built
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Architect> another block right
<Builder> feel free to give more than one direction at a time if you're comfortable
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Builder> e.g. one right, then one up
<Architect> one down, and then i have to check to see whats going on
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> one more down, then one away from you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> down and away from you again
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> then down and right
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> i think that's it, i'm going to check really quickly
