<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Architect> this one is kind of like a rainbow using three colors
<Architect> it stands up, and all blocks lie within the same plane
<Builder> ready
<Architect> on two edges, along the same row, place a red block at each end
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> now put a purple block to the right of the left red block, leaving a one block gap
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> wait sorry, that purple should be on the ground
<Builder> i thought you said it stands up
<Architect> yeah, it will
<Architect> patience!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> do the same thing on the right side
<Architect> but going inwards
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, now using the same technique, place yellow blocks relative to those purple blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now think of these as the bases of three separate arches
<Architect> in those colors
<Builder> i see
<Architect> let's start simple with yellow
<Architect> put a yellow block on the next layer up and between those on the ground
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> that finishes the yellow arch
<Architect> now for purple
<Architect> on the left purple block, put one purple block diagonally up and right of it
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> this whole shape is symmetric, so you can do the same for the other side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> up and right one more time
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> now connect those two top purple blocks in the middle, on the same level
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> we'll do a similar pattern for the red blocks, except now there will be four blocks going up diagonally instead of three
<Builder> connected at the top in the same layer?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes, you'll end up with a row of 5 connected at the top
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> done
<Architect> cool! that's our rainbow
<Architect> sort of
<Builder> its not right?
<Architect> no it's right, it's just not really a rainbow :P
<Builder> oh gotcha
