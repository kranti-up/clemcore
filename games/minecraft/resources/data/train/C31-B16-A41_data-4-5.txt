<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay, we are going to make the word HOT. First let's make the H. It is floating one square above the ground.
<Builder> the entire H is floating?
<Builder> Also color?
<Architect> So first make a row of three blue squares, parallel to an edge of the map, a few blocks away from the corner

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> Perfect. Now make three more rows
<Architect> On top of that row

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> One more row on top, then delete the bottom row

[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> And delete the middle blocks on the top and bottom rows to make an H
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Okay now we will make an orange O. The left hand side of the O is in front of the right hand side of the H, with one space separating them.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> No, it is in front of the H
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Yes perfect. Now build to the right
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> No wait!
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> Okay-- sorry!
<Architect> The O is parallel to the H
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> But in front and offset to the right.
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Needs to be shifted two spaces right.
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Sorry, when I say "right" I mean relative to the H.
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Yes exactly!
<Builder> this hopefully?
<Architect> Sorry haha
<Builder> nice! it's alright!
<Architect> Okay, now build a 3x3 O on top, so it is floating at the same height as the H

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Yay!
<Builder> this?
<Builder> nice!
<Architect> Yes perfect. Now the T follows the same pattern - we need a row of three green blocks that starts one block in front of the right hand side of the O
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yes exactly
<Architect> Now make three more green rows and remove the bottom row, and two bottom blocks on each side to make a T
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
