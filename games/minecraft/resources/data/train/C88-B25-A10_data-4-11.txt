<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, so here there are three separate structures. one is a floating 3 by 3 square.
<Architect> it is a vertical 3 by 3 square
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> orange
<Architect> and it's floating only one above the ground
<Builder> how far from the edge should i build it?
<Builder> is it the rightmost or leftmost part of the build
<Architect> centering it should suffice
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool. so the other two structures are the same, just repeated and translated.
<Architect> all blue blocks
<Builder> how far apart are they, and what colors?
<Builder> ok
<Builder> how many blocks forward or backward?
<Architect> the left one is 4 down from the leftblocks in the square
<Architect> the structures kind of look like diagonal ms
<Architect> "M" s

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Builder> is it like that?
<Architect> yeah, just go ahead and remove the lower triangle of the square and the top left corner
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Architect> not quite.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Builder> which blocks should i take out?
<Architect> remove the top left
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> remove the bottom right
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Architect> remove the blocks adjacent to the left and up of what you jsut removed
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Builder> ah I see the M now
<Builder> where is the other M?
<Architect> yeah, then re-make that structure, translate it up one and right four
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> so the bottom left cube is up one and over 4
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> cool
<Builder> ok
