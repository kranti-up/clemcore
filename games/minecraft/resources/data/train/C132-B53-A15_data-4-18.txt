<Architect> worries*
<Builder> I'm out of purple blocks
<Architect> oh, snap
<Architect> okay, well, remove the bottom block from each stack
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> that was the next step anyway
<Builder> Ah I see
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> alright, remove the middle block from the left stack
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> and the 3rd stack from the left
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> in the other two stacks, remove the block above that
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> and fill in all the gaps with red blocks :)
<Builder> Easy enough
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect! easy peasy
<Builder> Indeed
