<Builder> ok, no worries.
<Architect> and build six red blocks in a line upwards
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> the top block is the middle of a five cube line that extends to your right and left
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> second to top is the same but a 3 cube line
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> now there's a three cube orange line on top of the long red line, centered the same
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> on the right two blocks build two more orange blocks up
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> and then one more orange block on the top right
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:9 Z:0]
<Architect> yep! that's it!
