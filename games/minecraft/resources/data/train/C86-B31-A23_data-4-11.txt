<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this is an elaborate one.
<Builder> let's do it
<Architect> start with four blocks laid in a row in the center
<Builder> does it matter what color?
<Architect> sorry purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> the final product will look like a butterfly. this is its body
<Architect> next, blue blocks
<Builder> got it
<Architect> we are making antennae. from on of the end purple blocks, place a blue block on the corner.

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> not quite
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> sorry. it should be flat
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> one closer to you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> on that same diagonal, place another blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> perfect. now do that on the other side.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> nailed it
<Architect> so the rest of the blocks are orange.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> one second
<Architect> so this is our base. i didn't realize it was floating. copy each block up one, and then remove the ones on the plate
<Architect> aka shift the design up into the air.

<Builder> done
<Architect> okay. orange blocks next
<Builder> got it
<Architect> the blue is the head of the butterfly
<Builder> okay
<Architect> so on block down from the purple head, place two orange blocks on the sides of the butterfly body
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> we are going up at an angle. so bear with me.
<Architect> on a side of it, place another orange block going outward
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> same on the other one?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> if its mirrored you could describe one side and I'll fill in the other
<Architect> so add one block on both sides of the upper orange block along the same direction as the body.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> it is mirrored
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> is that right?
<Architect> add another block same row, towards the head as well. yes that is correct
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect.
<Architect> you will be doing the same thing but instead of a row of three, a row of five. one diagonal upwards like before

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes!

<Architect> almost done. we will need to remove the middle block of the orange row with three in it.
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> let me check the design to make sure we have this right
<Builder> okay
<Architect> done!
