<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> ready!
<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
<Builder> no worries!
<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
<Builder> is that what you mean?
<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
