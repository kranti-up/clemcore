<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Ok, this structure will take some space, so I would back up a few steps
<Architect> We'll start with a yellow row of length 4

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> actually, could you rotate the row?

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Awesome! Now in front and behind the block you are looking at, add a yellow brick
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> Nice! now we'll add two green bricks diagonal to the top of the cross
<Architect> So that there is a yello-yellow-green diagonal
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Now we'll move to the second layer
<Architect> We'll actually make the same cross plus two diagonals twice, but in different places with different colors
<Builder> okay!
<Architect> The first one will be red and orange, where the bottom of the crossis three to the left and one above the top of the yellow cross

<Architect> You've got it!
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> So as a reminder, you'll make the same structure, but with red and orange
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> You've got it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:2]

<Architect> The next shape we'll make will be purple and blue
<Architect> It will also be on the second layer
<Architect> The blue bricks will 3 in front of and 5 in front of the top of the yellow cross
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Not quite
<Builder> here?
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> You were actually just there
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Ah wait, ok, that was bad on my part
<Builder> no problem!
<Architect> So the blue bricks will be on the same line as the yellow bricks
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> one to the left and one to the right of there!

<Architect> You got it! positioning these without using xyz coordinates can be tricky
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> true! no problem though
