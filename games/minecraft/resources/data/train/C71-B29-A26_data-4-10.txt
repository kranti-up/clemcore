[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]

<Architect> Actually we might need to make the column start a few more spaces to the left
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> below the most recently placed orange brick, add a yellow brick

<Architect> the yellow brick will be the 3rd brick in a row of 7 yellow bricks, going forward to backward
<Architect> so 2 will be in front of it
<Architect> and 4 will be behind it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
