<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay
<Architect> sorry, hi, first of all
<Architect> let's start near the center of the board
<Builder> on the ground?
<Architect> there's only going to be one block on the ground
<Architect> everything else extends up from that
<Architect> make it a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> this is going to be the base of a T shape
<Architect> three high, three wide
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> let's start with the left side of this T since it's simpler
<Architect> build another red block diagonally up and left from the left end of the T. it should lie on the same plane
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> do this one more time but with a green block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> that looked rough but you got it
<Architect> okay, now for the right side
<Architect> on top of the right end of the T, place two more red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> directly to the right of those two you just placed, place green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> place another red block on top of that top green block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> diagonally up and right of that top red block, place a green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> extending out from the bottom green block on the right, place two green blocks
<Builder> this one?
<Architect> i think so, it's a little hard for me to tell what you're exactly looking at
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> no no, to the right of it
<Architect> still on the same plane as everything else
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> okay, we are done with this plane. there are a few more blocks on the planes directly in front of and behind all this stuff
<Builder> ready
<Architect> directly in front of the bottom left two green blocks, put green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> oops
<Architect> the second one isn't right
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> put it along that bottom row
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> my bad
<Architect> wait
<Architect> you removed the one that was correct
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> not quite
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> it's to the right of that newest green block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah!
<Architect> okay now go over to the other side of this thing
<Architect> you see how there's a row of three green blocks here on the left?
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> we're going to put one last green block on the middle of that row, towards you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> got it
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> let me check that everything is right
<Architect> cool looks good!
