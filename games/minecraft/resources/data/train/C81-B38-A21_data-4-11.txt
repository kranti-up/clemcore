<Architect> first, you're gonna wanna place down 4 orange blocks in a square
<Builder> Is everything ok?
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> they should be 3 spaces apart from each other
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]

<Builder> like this?
<Architect> exactly
<Builder> Cool
<Architect> next, place a yellow block diagonally inward from each block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> Ok
<Builder> What's in the center?
<Architect> now place another yellow block on top of each of those
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]

<Builder> Cool
<Architect> then delete the yellow block in the middle
<Builder> The one under the red block?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> Ok, I did that. Is there anything else?
