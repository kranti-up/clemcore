<Architect> ok this one is complicated so im sorry in advance
<Builder> that's ok.
<Architect> ok in the middle of the board place four blue blocks in a row
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> ok now on the end blocks build two more blue blocks up
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> on both sides
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> now connect those two towers to form a box
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> now along side that top row build a row of 4 purple blocks overhanging
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> now overhanging those will be 2 more purple blocks in the center
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok now you will need to remove the 2 purple blocks attaching the outermost blocks to the blue square
<Architect> so the middle 2 of the row of 4 purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]

<Architect> ok now on the other side from the purple build a row of 3 yellow blocks starting o nthe left
<Builder> should I start them below where I am now, overhanging the blue structure?
