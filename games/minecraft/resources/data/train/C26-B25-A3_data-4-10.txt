<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
<Architect> one second
<Builder> ok
<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
<Architect> should have specified
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah there
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> just going to center it a bit
<Builder> my bad
<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
<Architect> yeah there
<Builder> ok
<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> close, just up to the left

<Builder> my bad
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> just 1 more yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> ok nice
<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
