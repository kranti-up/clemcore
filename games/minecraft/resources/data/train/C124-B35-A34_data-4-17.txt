<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi there
<Architect> so these are triangels in many forms
<Builder> okay
<Architect> place on eblue block 2 away from the center diagonally
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> there
<Architect> now do a 90 and look at the left side
<Architect> build that V structure,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]

[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> it sould be a vertical line
<Architect> only 3 high
<Builder> ?
<Builder> what
<Architect> yeah so the 2 edges of the V are the 2 sides of the triangle
<Architect> the third side is just the top
<Builder> ohhh

<Architect> perf
<Architect> switch to red
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place that red in that hole

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> great
<Architect> red triangle done
<Architect> now the yellow triangle
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so go to that last block of 6 that you made
<Architect> good stay with that perspective
<Architect> place one yellow to the left of that block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> that is the right angle edge
<Architect> verticie
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place 3 yellow towards you and 3 to the left of that block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
