<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hello
<Builder> hi
<Architect> We will build something very simple. It looks like a small 'L'
<Builder> alright
<Architect> It will be made entirely out of blue blocks
<Builder> do you want to do something like an x-y coordinate system?
<Architect> Place two blocks next to one another on the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> No, no x-y coordinate system
<Architect> Perfect, not on top of the left block, put another blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> Perfect! We're done with this warm up
