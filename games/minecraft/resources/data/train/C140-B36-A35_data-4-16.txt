<Architect> left most side
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> centerish
<Architect> alright now go left
<Builder> here?
<Architect> opposite side
<Builder> here?
<Architect> sorry your reference is different from mine
<Builder> it's ok
<Architect> go up like 6 blocks
<Architect> like movement
<Builder> forward or up?
<Architect> forward
<Architect> other direction
<Architect> yup
<Builder> here?
<Architect> okay move 1 block to the right
<Builder> which direction am i facing for you right now?
<Architect> go back 1
<Architect> that was my forward
<Builder> ok
<Architect> our coordinates are lined up
<Architect> move to the right
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> okay build 4 blocks
<Builder> vertically or horizontal?
<Architect> each block place behind that block
<Architect> horizontal
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> other way
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like this
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now do the same thing 1 block to the right of that 1
<Builder> am i facing your forward or your right right now?
<Architect> so there should be a space between the two columns
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> after that, do the same thing
<Architect> again
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> okay now move 1 block forward
<Architect> in the gap above the two columns
<Architect> place a purple block above the empty space
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> it should be above the orange block
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> 1 second I'm going to rephrase it
<Builder> or do you want me to connect the columns
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> connect the columns
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do that for the block underneath that 1
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> so 2 blocks
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> in each empty space
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like filling in the gaps?
<Architect> remove the last 2 blocks u placed
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> okay now build vertically in the Z direction
<Architect> those 2 purple blocks should be floating above
<Architect> its not all flat
<Builder> oh ok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> like that
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do the same for the other 1
<Builder> ok
<Architect> but yeah
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> good?
<Architect> yeah but that 2nd purple column should have 1 more block
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> there's 3 blocks in that column. delete the one underneath
<Architect> I think you double place
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> ok good
<Builder> o sorry
<Architect> no worries
<Architect> oka so now move to the other empty column
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now using yellow
<Architect> place 2 blocks in the empty space. 1 block should connect the orange columns and the other should be just underneath them
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> no
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> so you know how you're facing the bottom of the columns
<Builder> o ok
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok cool
<Architect> okay now do that again but to the right of the orange column
<Architect> also don't keep moving your cam, it messes our reference
<Architect> not there, other side
<Builder> o sorry
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay now do that again to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> should like the 3 orange columns
<Builder> like this?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> to the right 1 more space
<Builder> my right?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> 1 more
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> no 1 more to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> do the same thing, but 1 more row to the right
<Builder> same thing as the yellow blocks or orange blocks?
<Architect> there should be a space between the last yellow column you made and the next yellow 1 you will make
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay now similar to what we did with the purple
<Architect> use blue and place them vertical in the empty space between the yellow. 1 block should be on the bottom of the yellow, and 1 should hang
<Architect> dont move
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so from where you're standing
<Architect> the blocks in front of you building up should be: empty space, blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now build 1 block in front of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeas
<Builder> ok cool
<Architect> now do the same thing for the other yellow
<Architect> space
<Architect> on ur left
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> I need u to go back to the side with purple
<Architect> and 1 block that hangs of the edge on each of them
<Architect> like how you did with the blue
<Architect> in purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> sorry that was hard to explain. But we're done
<Builder> nice!
