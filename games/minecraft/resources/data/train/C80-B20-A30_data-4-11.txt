<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> Alright. How big?
<Architect> it is 6 squares long and 3 squares wide
<Architect> it looks like a man doing a lunge or running
<Architect> start by building a stack of 3 blue blocks right where you're looking
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> and then from the top block towards the far end of the space, build 2 more blocks off the side
<Builder> this side?
<Architect> the other side
<Builder> this one?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> from the farthest out block you just built, build one to the side that you are standing on
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok now think of that front upside down L as the front leg in a lunge and now we are building the back leg
<Builder> am I just building an L?
<Architect> so build an L down from the most recently placed blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> add one more to the bottom
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok now delete the corner block of that L
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> in the inner corner of that L, build one blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> now delete the 2 blocks that it is touching
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> ok now at the top of the legs, where the hips would be, place one red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> here? for each leg?
<Architect> on the other one at the hip area
<Architect> just one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> now add another red block on top of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> now 2 yellow blocks on top of those
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> and delete the lower yellow block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok that is the body now we need to build the arms
<Architect> on the side with the upside down L, build an orange line out from the top red block that is 3 blocks long
<Builder> this way?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-4]
<Architect> sorry, start from the side of the red block, not the front
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok sorry this is confusing to explain. start from the side, keeping the inner most orange block that youve already places, but build out towards the front
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> ok now at the furthest out orange block, place an orange block on top of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> now delete the one it is touching
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> good! one more arm to go
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> build an upsisde down orange L
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> how big?
<Architect> delete the top orange block you just placed. begin from the bottom one going backwards. it will be 3x3
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> good! now place an orange block in the inner corner
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yep! thats it!
