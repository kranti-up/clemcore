<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Builder> hey
<Architect> this is a bunch of giant block numbers
<Architect> start with orange and stop waving at me
<Architect> in about the middle build a column five tall
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> then two more to the left of the top to make a 7
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> now a yellow 6
<Architect> the long edge of the 6 aligns with the stem of the 7 and faces right
<Builder> Where does the 6 start?
<Architect> behind the 7 from your perspective
<Builder> Is it directly adjacent?
<Architect> yes directly behind it. touches it

<Architect> too much overlap unfortunately
<Architect> the colummn of the 6 is right behind the column of hte 7
<Builder> Ah okay, I see

<Architect> awesome good fix
<Builder> Anything else?
<Architect> now a purple 8
<Architect> the right edge of the 8 is diagonal to the left of the 6
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> finally a green 5
<Architect> he left edge of the five overlaps the right edge of the 8
<Builder> behind the 8 I'm assuming?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> it'll be a 2 from this backward perspective
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Builder> Yes
<Architect> great
