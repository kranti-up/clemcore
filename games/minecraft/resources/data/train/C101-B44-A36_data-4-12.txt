<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi
<Builder> was that last one a warmup? seemed really easy
<Architect> ya haha
<Architect> get a yellow block
<Builder> you don't have to give me individual instructions for getting out colored blocks. Just tell me to place x colored block here or there
<Architect> ok cool
<Architect> move so that you're at the third row from the bottom of the square
<Architect> ok place 2 orange blocks flat next to each other
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> oh sorry place the 2 blocks so that one is in front of you and the other one is behind that one
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]

<Architect> then place a block on top of each
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]

<Architect> uh step so that you're on top of the block in front of you
<Architect> and then place a green block on the top layer
<Architect> wait
<Architect> to the side of the top layer
<Builder> I think the instructions would be more effective if you told me where to place blocks relative to where other blocks are rather than where I am located
