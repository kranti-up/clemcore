<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
<Builder> :((((( okkk
<Architect> start in the center
<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> that was in front of you
<Builder> o sorry
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> other way
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
<Architect> get on the ground
<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> good?
<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
<Builder> in yellow?
<Architect> in blue
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> good
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay now go back to reference
<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
<Architect> and build 4 high.
<Architect> in yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> place 2 more blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place in front of that yellow
<Architect> should be building toward u
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
<Builder> ooooh
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
<Builder> ok
<Architect> yeah
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> I was wrong
<Architect> keep what u have
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
<Builder> ok
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
<Architect> move back
<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
<Architect> then delete
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> other way
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> same idea, but other direction
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> go back to reference
<Architect> float back to the top
<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
<Builder> ya
<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
<Builder> ooooo
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> okay last step
<Builder> ok
<Architect> use red
<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
<Architect> so it's like floating
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> loks like a banana doing a handstand
<Builder> omg
<Architect> we're done
