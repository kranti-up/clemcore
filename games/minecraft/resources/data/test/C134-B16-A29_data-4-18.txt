<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi again! more building
<Architect> hello
<Architect> this one is like a very colorful parachute
<Builder> exciting!
<Architect> so, 8 up in the air
<Architect> we need a 3x3 square that lies flat
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> the middle column will be purple
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> the two outside columns are blue
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:9 Z:1]
<Architect> it needs to lie flat
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Architect> there you go
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:9 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> now on each blue side
<Architect> one block down
<Architect> make a column of 3 green blocks at an angle to the blue ones
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> not quite
<Architect> as if you make 3 green blocks adjacent to the blue
<Architect> but shifted down a block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> let's try this a different way
<Builder> alright, sorry!
<Architect> build 3 green blocks adjacent to the blue blocks
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:9 Z:1]
<Architect> we want them exactly adjacent
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:4 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Architect> so add another
<Architect> right
<Architect> now make 3 green blocks exactly below those
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:9 Z:1]
<Architect> now remove the green blocks on top
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now perform the same operation
<Architect> with yellow blocks
<Architect> with respect to the green ones
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:8 Z:1]
<Architect> now do the same thing on the other side
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:9 Z:0]
<Architect> for both green and yellow so there is symmetry
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:1]

<Architect> so that's the parachute
<Architect> now we need the lines that one would be suspended from
<Architect> they are brown
<Architect> and begin from the middle yellow block on each side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> they are 3 blocks on the diagonal toward the middle of the chute
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> sorry i didn't see your question
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> now one red one
<Architect> between the bottom 2 and down one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> down one
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
