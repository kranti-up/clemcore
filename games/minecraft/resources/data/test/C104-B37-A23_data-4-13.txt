<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> So this one is like a two legged spider. You'll see what I mean shortly.
<Architect> go to the middle of one side
<Architect> one row inward from the side, stack five red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the other side, one row in, stack another five red blocks.
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4]
<Architect> connect the tops with a red bridge.
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> good
<Architect> the rest are orange/
<Architect> on the top of the middle three red, place a block. not a stack
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect. on either side of that, on the oranges, place a row of three blocks. should be a 3X3 square
<Architect> when looking down on it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> on the hanging oranges, hang one block off of each block. on both sides.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the side you are on is the front.
<Architect> and we will only be working on this side for the rest
<Architect> add one more hanging row
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> and then add a hanging row of five across
<Builder> are these still orange blocks? because I'm going to run out of orange
<Architect> okay. you will be removing the middle block of the last row you added. and the middle three blocks of the row youre about to add.
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Builder> I think so
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> yay
