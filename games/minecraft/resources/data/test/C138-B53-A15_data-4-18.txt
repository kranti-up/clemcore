<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> alright, we're building a rainbow of concentric horseshoes
<Builder> Sounds easy enough
<Architect> you'd think!
<Builder> Which color is first?
<Architect> alright, make a hollow 3x3 square of orange blocks in the center
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and then delete one of the middle blocks on any edge
<Builder> Vertical or horizontal?
<Architect> so it's a horseshoe
<Architect> horizontal, parallel to the ground
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> okay, now, in front of the open end, make a vertical blue horeshoe oriented like an "n"
<Architect> all horseshoes are the same size
<Architect> different colors and orientations
<Builder> Should it be perpendicular to the existing one?
<Architect> yes, sorry
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> alright, row of 3 red blocks on top of the row of 3 oranges ones opposite the blue blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> I believe this is what you meant
<Architect> yes! extend that to a horseshoe facing the opposite direction of the orange one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Builder> It is done
<Architect> perfect! now a row of purple blocks in front of the open end of the red one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:4]
<Architect> make that into a vertical "u"
<Builder> Gotcha
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> row of green on top of that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:4]
<Architect> make that into a "c"
<Builder> Facing towards the middle?
<Architect> parallel to the purple one, facing away from you
<Architect> so it should be in the same plane as the purple horeshoe
<Architect> and the open end should be on the opposite end you're currently on
<Builder> Oh I see
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:4]
<Architect> alright, now, in front of the tips of the green horseshoe, put two yellow blocks
<Builder> I hope there's also a yellow one
<Builder> GOod
<Architect> in front as in towards the blue blocks
<Architect> so perpendicular
<Builder> And then make a "c" from those?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> yeah, that's the tip of the horeshoe
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect! easier than i thought it would be
<Architect> good job!
