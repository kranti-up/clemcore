<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, another hard one
<Architect> start with a stack of 4 orange blocks in the center
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> alright, now, put another orange block next to the top one, and next to the second one from the bottom
<Architect> they should both be coming out of the same side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, now, you want another orange block between the two you just put down, but one space towards you
<Architect> so there's a little hole
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> okay, now, you're gonna want a 3x3 square of purple blocks, parallel to the ground, and centered on top of the stack of orange blocks
<Builder> so is the top of the stack the center of the 3x3 or is it floating above it?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> it's above it. start by putting a single purple block on top of the stack
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> and then build a square around it, like that, yeah!
