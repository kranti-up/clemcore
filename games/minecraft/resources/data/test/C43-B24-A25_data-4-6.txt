<Architect> kk, this one is a lil crazy
<Builder> aright
<Architect> you need 7 blocks worth of space
<Architect> since thata's how big it is at its widest point
<Architect> but start by putting two red blocks 1 block apart
<Builder> k
<Builder> what corner of the structure are we starting on
<Architect> the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> it's symmetric from the center
<Architect> then put a row of 7 green blocks down, 3 on top of the blocks you put down, and then 2 hanging off both sides
<Architect> just as a single line of green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> yea like that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> from here on out all the stuff you need to do is centered from the middle
<Architect> put down 5 green blocks on top of these 7
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> then 3 blocks on top of these 5
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> then 3 YELLOW blocks on top of these 3
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> then 3 more yellow blocks on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> then 5 yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:2]
<Architect> then one red block, and we're done
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0]
