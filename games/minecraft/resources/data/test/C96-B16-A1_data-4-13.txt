[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:5]
<Architect> place three more blocks each touching a face of the block you just placed
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:5]
<Architect> yeah that good
<Builder> cool
<Architect> no on the opposite side place the same thing with green blocks
<Architect> now*
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:5]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:5]
<Architect> diagonally opposite sorry
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:5]
<Architect> hmm.. can you place those blocks on the diagonally opposite corner of the red blocks?
<Builder> oh, wwo, sorry!
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:5]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah in that corner
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> okay now where you had the green blocks before build the same thing but with yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:5]
<Architect> and finally the opposite side with purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> yes thats it :-)
<Builder> great! is it that the end? if you, you can quit if you'd like
