<Architect> i don't really know how to describe this one
<Builder> lol all good
<Architect> just looks like random stuff
<Architect> start by putting a hollow 3x3 square flat on the ground, using green
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the other side from where you're standing, make a step up like a staircase, also 3 wide
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yup!
<Builder> cool
<Architect> we'll step up twice more, but the second step in the staircase (the one you'll make first) is hollow in the middle
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:5]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> so now we're going to make that last part of the structure with the three steps again, but they'll be lying on their side
<Architect> go back to the original viewpoint you had when you made that square
<Builder> okay
<Builder> am I building towards me?
<Architect> you'll place one on the ground then build upwards
<Architect> then away from you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> so first put a blue block diagonally down and right from teh bottom right corner of the square
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> sorry haha this structure is kind of separate from the green one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> oh okay gotcha lol
<Architect> make that a pillar of 3
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> now diagonally up and right from there, you'll make the hollow stair
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> uhh
<Builder> I don't quite follow
<Architect> so if you take a directly top-down view, it will look like a staircase going up and right
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> oh okay
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> then the last stair
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> nice, think that's it
<Builder> sweet!
