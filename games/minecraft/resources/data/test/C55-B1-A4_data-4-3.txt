<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi; this one is shitty
<Architect> start with yellow
<Architect> place one in the center of one of the lines near the edge
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now still on the flat surface place one above each of the diagonal corners
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> like a c?
<Architect> good; repeat to make a V
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> still diagonal from the previous squares
<Builder> extended?
<Builder> oh ok
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> good
<Architect> switch to orange
<Architect> now you're building a 3d staircase from the top of one of the sides of the V
<Architect> start on the flat surface
<Architect> one above the outer yellow block
<Architect> either side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:2]

<Architect> stand at one of teh outer blocks
<Architect> put one in front of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> now build a 3d staircase
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> diagonal slope
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> jutting away from the V
<Builder> the first step is yellow right?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> not really; the first step is orange, but it is in line with the yellow blocks
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> okay build one more orange in front of that orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> now one orange on top of teh second orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> now delete the second orange
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> good repeat to make a third step
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> now build that same structure on the other side of the V
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> well done
<Architect> switch to red
<Builder> ok
<Architect> you're making a diamond
<Architect> put a red block in front of the final orange blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> same on other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> now one below the red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> and to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> is it a bridge?
<Architect> you're essentially making that V shape in red, but it's vertical
<Architect> delete those
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> no all the red blocks are in the same plane
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep one above that now

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Builder> above the red?
<Architect> yep; it's an upside down V in red still
