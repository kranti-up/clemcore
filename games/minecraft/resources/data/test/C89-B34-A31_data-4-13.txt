<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hmm, not sure what these are. We will figure it out along the way
<Builder> alright sure
<Architect> This first object will be made of red blocks
<Architect> About one block in from a corner, place a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> one block in is towards me?
<Builder> so like there?
<Architect> Sorry, one block away from a corner. That needs to be a little closer to an edge
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> That's perfect
<Builder> oh from a corner. I read center
<Architect> Lol, no worries
<Architect> Now look at it so the red block is in the bottom left corner of the large white base
<Architect> Stack three more red blocks on top of the existing red block.
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Builder> just like that
<Architect> Great, now off of the top red block, build four more blocks going toward the right edge of the white base
<Builder> in red?
<Architect> Yes, red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> Just like that
<Architect> Connect the top right block to the ground. It should be just like the other end of the red structure
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> perfect
<Architect> Cool, now build two red blocks downward from the middle red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> It should look like an 'm'
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Awesome. Like that
<Architect> Now we will be working in yellow for the rest of the object
<Architect> Go to the bottom right corner of the 'm'
<Architect> Behind the 'm' place a yellow block so there is one block space between it and the bottom right red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Great
<Builder> ;)
<Architect> Place another yellow block on top of that. We will delete this block later
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> I'm going to make it purple so I remember to delete it
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> Place a yellow block of the left side of that block you just put down
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> Good idea
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> You can delete the purple block now
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> Build another yellow block on top of the one you just put down
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> And put one purple block on top of that (to delete later)
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> On the right side of that purple block, place a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> I'ts hard to find a good perspective for you
<Builder> *It's
<Architect> It's okay, we're doing good
<Architect> You can delete the purple block
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> Build two more yellow blocks going to the right off that top yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> Awesome, now place one yellow block on the underside of the middle block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> Great. Now place a purple block on the right side of the top yellow row
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> is this symmetrical?
<Architect> Two yellow blocks coming down from that purple one
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> Yep, it's symmetrical
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ??
<Architect> Not sure what they are, but that's complete
<Builder> yeah idk
<Architect> nice work
