<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> start on one edge of the space and build a staircase towards the middle with yellow block that is 3 stairs high
<Builder> ok, tell me if this is right...

<Architect> exactly right but can you move it towards the middle

<Architect> yes exactly! ok now delete the boxes underneath, leaving only the steps
<Builder> so far we've built an L, a large duck, a funky staircase, and a cube shaped house. How would you describe the end goal of this build?
<Architect> abstract. there are a lot of stair type pieces in red yellow and orange
<Builder> cool, that might help, maybe...haha
<Architect> lol. ok now delete the bottom pieces of the stairs leaving only the parts you would use for steps
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> now stand as if you were standing at the bottom stair
<Architect> ok now 4 blocks to the left and 3 blocks forward place a red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> now it will be a diagonal staircase with 4 steps angling towards the middle
<Architect> if that makes sense
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> diagonal staircase with this orientation?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> towards where the yellow blocks are pointing

<Architect> ok now there will be an orange staircase with 4 steps starting one row ahead of the red on the other side of the yellow also pointing towards the middle
<Builder> is it also three spaces out from the yellow blocks?
