[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> one space in the middle and place another yellow to the left
<Architect> right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> there
<Architect> now in that gap, place a green one above the ground
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> up and left of that yellow block on the right, place a green
<Builder> up and left?
<Builder> isn't there already a block there?
<Architect> sorry let me rephrase that
<Architect> 2 left from that green block, place another green

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now kep one space above both yellow blocks and place 1 blue block above each yellow block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> like a checkered pattern
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> 2 above the green, place purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> one lower
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> now move to the other side

<Architect> 180 the figure
<Architect> yes
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> place a block of red one infront and left of both yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now orange on the next level up
<Architect> the same pattern as the other sided
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> now yellow
