<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> Place three blue blocks in the center of a row
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> You can start about three rows down from top
<Builder> sure
<Builder> exact center?
<Builder> or roughly?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> No it doesn't really matter there should just be enough space to build a few blocks on on all sides
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks one below the other in front of the left one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Oh sorry I didn't mean on top
<Architect> I meant next to the left one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah that's right!
<Architect> This entire structure is flat so there is no stacking at all
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks on the right of the block you're standing right in front
<Architect> right in front of
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great!
<Architect> Now put two green blocks in the center to form a 3X3 square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Cool. Now place another green block next to the green one on the right so that it juts out of the square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Perfect. Now place two green blocks behind it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> Great, this is the last step. Place two green blocks right next to the one jutting out
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> done?
<Architect> yes done!
<Builder> :)
