<Architect> hi!
<Builder> what are we building today?
<Architect> we are building a chair; sorry for the delay, was working on controls
<Architect> so to start
<Builder> no problem at all
<Architect> build two rows of yellow blocks parallel to one another
<Builder> upright or on the ground?
<Architect> should be 3 blocks in length, separated by one space
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> build red blocks to fill in the center space between the two rows
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> build an orange square on top on that structure
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> so it is flat '

<Builder> awesome
<Builder> i'll let you end us so you can check the final product each time
