<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi!
<Architect> not really sure how to describe this one
<Builder> salut
<Architect> close to an edge, start by placing 2 orange blocks with 3 blank spaces between them
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> k
<Architect> on the left block, put another orange block diagonally up and right of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> do the same for the other block, except going inwards
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on those two top blocks, put one orange block each going towards you
<Builder> same level?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> now connect those last two in the middle, such that they make a U shape if you look from above
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> cool, done with orange blocks
<Architect> let's use green
<Architect> on that middle block you just placed, put a green block on the face going towards you, same level
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> wait, can you go back to the perspective you were at before
<Architect> oh okay, this works
<Architect> now, one more green block diagonally towards you and up
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> is this what you meant
<Architect> oh, wait
<Architect> you had it and then removed it
<Architect> it's to the left of the top block you have here
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yup!
<Builder> i thought you said right for some reason
<Architect> oh haha
<Architect> can you do that one more time
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay cool, we finished one part of the structure
<Architect> can you go behind the structure now
<Architect> so opposite here
<Builder> ready
<Architect> two to the left and three forwards from the bottom left orange block, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> correct?
<Architect> i think so!
<Architect> then put another purple diagaonally up and to the right of that one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> diagonally*
<Architect> that's close, but when i said "up" i meant up one layer
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> one more similar looking structure
<Architect> two blocks forward from the top purple block, put a red
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Builder> i think
<Architect> yeah! now make the mirror image of the purple structure in red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Builder> done!
<Architect> uhh
<Architect> so put the bottom red on the other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> thats not mirror
<Architect> sorry i'm bad at explaining
<Architect> let me just check that it's right
<Builder> across no centerline is that a mirror
<Architect> across the axis that connects the top purple and red? idk
<Architect> just shifted
<Architect> okay, this looks good
<Builder> looks like a some sea monsters with just their heads poking out of the water
<Architect> i could see that
