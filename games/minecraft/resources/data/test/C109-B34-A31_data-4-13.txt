<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello again
<Architect> Hello. This next one is abstract
<Builder> fun
<Architect> In the center, build a tower of five yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Good, now we will be using red blocks
<Architect> Place a red block on one side of the top yellow block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> Now look at the structure so the red block is on the right
<Architect> Place another red block on the back side of the current red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Sorry, the other side of the red block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> Yes, like that
<Builder> alright
<Architect> Now place another red block to the right of the red block you just placed
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Builder> there
<Builder> do you want me to stand at a different perspective or is this the easiest position?
<Architect> Good, now fill in red blocks on the underside of the existing red blocks, so they are two layers high
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> like a flag
<Builder> ish
<Architect> It does look like a flag. We are done with this building phase
