<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> start here?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> a C?
<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes like that
<Builder> go it
<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
<Architect> yes please
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
<Builder> okay
<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
<Builder> okay. here?
<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
<Builder> let me try
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> is the orientation correct?
<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
<Builder> so flat?

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yes like that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
<Builder> okay
<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yes like that
<Builder> extending like this?

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> very good builder
<Builder> is that it?
<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
<Builder> that are perpendicular
<Builder> then the interlocking one..
<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
<Builder> okay
<Architect> i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder!
<Builder> good job
