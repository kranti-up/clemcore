<Architect> this one is a big yellow arch with some stuff going through it, not sure what exactly
<Builder> lets do it
<Architect> near the center of the board, build a yellow arch 6 blocks tall and 5 blocks wide
<Builder> like an upside down u
<Builder> or like the st louis arch
<Architect> i don't know what the st louis arch looks like tbh
<Builder> ..
<Architect> it's a U without rounded edges

<Architect> cool
<Builder> arc de triumph
<Architect> if you say so
<Architect> on one side of the arch, in the middle, put a red block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> uhhh okay sorry i wasn't clear enough
<Architect> it's on the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, let's keep this perspective
<Architect> on top of it and to its left, place one red block each
<Builder> each what
<Architect> one red block
<Architect> ?
<Architect> each
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?

[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> or this
<Architect> this is right
<Architect> now put one more red block one block towards you and one block to the right of the corner of that L shape
<Architect> backwards L, rather
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> uhh
<Architect> remove the first block you placed, but keep the second
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok, so from that second one, make another diagonal red block
<Architect> so that it comes towards you and to the right by one block each
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> now put one more red block on the last block you placed, on its face that is towards you
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now for the other side
<Architect> on the top red block, put one orange block on the side that's facing you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> now we're going to make two other orange blocks extend diagonally left and towards you from this first one
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Builder> maybe

<Architect> oops that's really close
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> i forgot to say they also go up
