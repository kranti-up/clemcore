<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> alright, so, this structure is gonna be all red blocks, and it's gonna be in 2D
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> start with a stack of 6 red blocks near the center
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> alright, now put another block next to the bottom one
<Architect> any direction is fine
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> make a stack of 4 blocks next to that
<Builder> right or left?
<Architect> in front of the single block. all the blocks are in the same 2d plane
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> okay, remove the bottom block from both stacks, but leave the single one on the ground
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> okay, now, starting with the shorter stack, you want a block one tile above and to the left of the top of the stack
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> good! and another block one tile below and to the left of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> excellent! now moving on to the taller stack, you want a block one tile above and to the right of the top of that stack
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> and another one below and to the right of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> cool! two more blocks underneath that last oen
<Architect> one*
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> and another one below and to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> and another one above and to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> and another one below and to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:5]
<Architect> and one more to the right :)
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:6]
<Architect> perfect! that was a mouthful
<Builder> lol
