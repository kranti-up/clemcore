<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Place two yellow blocks on the grid. This structure mostly goes upward so you don't need a lot of room. But don't go too close to the edges
<Builder> sounds good
<Builder> so a stack of yellow blocks?
<Architect> Sorry two next to each other
<Builder> cool
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great. Now stack another yellow one on top of the right one, and place another yellow one to the right of the stacked block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now you're going to stack three yellow blocks in a row, top on top of these and then one jutting out
<Builder> on top of which block?
<Architect> Oh sorry the two blocks you just stacked
<Builder> ah i see what you mean
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> i thought by stack you meant vertically stack
<Builder> is this what you had in mind?
<Architect> Sorry! I meant stack one on top of each
<Architect> Yes this is perfect
<Builder> ah!
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> Now stack a yellow block each on top of the center block and the right block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> just curious...what are we building?
<Architect> You stacked on the left and right. Can you move the left block to the center?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> I have no idea!
<Builder> ah my bad
<Builder> lol
<Builder> okay
<Architect> Great! Now we're going to place four purple blocks on a row on top of this. Two are stacked on the two blocks on top here
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> The other two jut out on either side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now stack four purple blocks in a row on top of this row
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> Now add a block to either side so it juts out. a row of six purple blocks total
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice! Now place four more purple blocks in a row on top of the four center blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:7 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Last step. Stack a purple block on each of the middle two blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1]
<Architect> We're done!
<Builder> gg
