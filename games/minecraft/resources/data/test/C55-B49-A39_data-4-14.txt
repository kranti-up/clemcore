<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again
<Builder> ready
<Architect> this one has a lot of diagonals again
<Architect> go to the center of an edge
<Builder> on the ground?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> we'll first make a yellow v-shape on the ground
<Architect> start by placing a yellow block where you are
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> then, diagonally left and right but staying on the ground, place two more yellow blocks on each side to make a V
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, but once more
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> no, sorry
<Architect> the thing makes a large V
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, on the ground in front of each of the tips of the V, place an orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> oops sorry, I meant behind :)
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so these are each going to be the starting step of a staircase going upwards
<Architect> we can just start on the left side for now, and you can do the same on the right side
<Architect> so you'll want two more orange blocks going diagonally up and away from the first orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> looks good. do the same for the other side
<Builder> more on the left?
<Architect> nope, that's it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, on the ends of those top orange blocks, facing away from you, put a red block on each
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now, we're going to make the same V-shape that's on the ground in yellow, but using red and it will be standing up to meet those two red blocks we placed
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> cool shape
<Architect> yup! and lastly, make an upside-down V in red that also uses those blocks as the ends
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> done i think
<Architect> we did it!
