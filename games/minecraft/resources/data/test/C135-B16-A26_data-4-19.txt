<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi again!
<Architect> Hello! This structure will start with a column of 5 purple bricks
<Architect> It's all purple

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> To the right of the top brick, add 4 more purple bricks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Please add one more
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! This will be the basis of a right-turn arrow
<Builder> alright!
<Architect> So we'll add a diagonal of two purple bricks above and to the left of the rightmost brick

<Architect> Maybe a better way to put it is, if you look at the middle brick of the top row, we want it to be the middle of a column of 5 bricks

<Architect> Great!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> oops, hang on

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> Yes!
<Architect> Now remove every other brick of the column you just added
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> so that there are 3 bricks left, one space apart
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> You completed my thought
<Architect> :)
