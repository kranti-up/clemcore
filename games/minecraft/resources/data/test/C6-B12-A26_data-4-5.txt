<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hey, so this time we'll start with a 4 blue blocks in a line
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> complete a 4x3 rectangle with the blue blocks

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Now, go the the right side of the rectangle
<Architect> We will build a 4x3 purple rectangle

<Architect> You're close. Its edge of height 3 will touch the blue rectangle
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> and the edge of length 4 will extend behind the blue rectagle

<Builder> good?
<Architect> You're close. If you looked at if from the sky, the blue and purple rectangles would make an L with 7 bricks
<Architect> if that helps
<Architect> 8 bricks*
<Builder> ok

<Architect> You got it!
<Architect> Now we'll build another rectangle. This one will be green and its center will contain the blue and purple bricks
<Architect> So the center would look like green-blue-purple-blue
<Architect> It will interlock with the other two rectangles
<Builder> green blue purple green maybe?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]

<Architect> Nice. Now we'll add a red rectangle, also lying on the second level.
<Builder> do you know the color of the obscured blocks?
<Architect> yes, the obscured blocks will be the colors of the rectangles to which they belong
<Architect> So you are doing ok
<Architect> The red rectangle will wrap around the column of the purple rectangle, and touch the green rectangle three times

<Architect> You're close! if you rotate the red rectangle, this will be correct
<Builder> rotate how?
<Architect> add a block in the space betwee nthe purple and red
<Builder> touch the green rectangle four times?
