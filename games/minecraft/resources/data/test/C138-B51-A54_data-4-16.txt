<Builder> ur good lol
<Architect> Now at theother side of the orange, build 3 reds on top of it, so they don't touch the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]

<Architect> Make that into a horizontal 3x3U
<Builder> which way is the bottom part going towards
<Architect> the part you did is the bottom
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> It's going to be parallel to the ground though
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this
<Architect> Yup
<Builder> nice
<Architect> At the two ends, place three purple blocks to form the base of a U
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-3]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> And a U that goes upward
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> Yup
<Architect> Build three green blocks on the purple one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> On top of the green, build a pillar of greens
<Architect> This one's basically going to be a sideways U
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> Yup
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:7 Z:-3]
<Architect> And the last U, on the other side of the green
<Architect> The edges touch the green's
<Builder> which color
<Architect> Oh yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> The base is at the other end so it should be 2 this tiem
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Exactly
<Builder> nice
