<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one is weird
<Architect> easy part is a big yellow arch. we'll start with that
<Builder> ok, where should i start?
<Architect> like 1 or 2 blocks to the left of center place 6 yellow blocks straight up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah like that. then put 4 more across the top going to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> need 2 more to go across the top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> nice
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> ok, what else are we looking at?
<Architect> ok the rest of the figure uses red and orange blocks in a random pattern
<Builder> on the ground, on the arch, in the air, or both?
<Architect> we'll just go 1 at a time its pretty weird
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place the first red block on the inner left side of the arch, 1 space toward you
<Builder> i'll stay in a fixed position so it's easier to give me directions with respect to what i'm looking at
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> right sounds good. ok then place 1 to the right of that new red block
<Architect> yeah perfect
<Builder> another red block?
<Architect> yeah anothe rred
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> then 1 red on top of the right red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> then another red to the bottom right of the right ground red block. so its connected but diagonal on the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> same thing to the new red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> then 1 more on the side toward you of that new red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> not diagonal though, just straight
<Builder> oh o
<Builder> ok*
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> my bad
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Builder> no problem
<Architect> ok thats it for red. now we do orange which all look to be in the air
<Architect> come around to the other side pls
<Architect> ok first orange block goes inside the arch connected to the topmost red block so that it comes toward you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> then there are 2 more orange blocks that go diagonally the the left of that one while raising up in the air 1 space each time. so we need placeholders
<Builder> wait i think I got this
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah just like that. let me take a look and make sure it's all right
<Architect> awesome i think we did it
<Builder> is this ketchup and cheddar take mcdonalds or something
<Architect> could be
