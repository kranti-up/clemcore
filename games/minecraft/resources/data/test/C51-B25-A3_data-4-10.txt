<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok it looks like 2 magnets interlinked sort of. first we'll start with a red U shape in the middle
<Architect> the U should be 3 across and 3 up on each side
<Builder> how many blocks wide is the whole figure?
<Builder> just so i can gauge where to start
<Architect> we will need a 4x4 space it looks like
<Builder> ok
<Architect> in total
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> forgot to mention this first U should be flat
<Builder> is that right?
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> but the shape is right
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> kk
<Architect> then place 1 orange block on the tip of each part of the U
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> great thats the first magnet. the next one is upright and we will start with the tips on the ground
<Architect> place 1 green block on the innermost part of the U
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> good now place another on the left side of the U directly across
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now if you could fill in the rest with blue blocks it should be finished
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> nice let me check the orientation
<Architect> yep
<Builder> nice nice
<Architect> whoops the second magnet is one shorter than that. my bad
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> ok looks good
