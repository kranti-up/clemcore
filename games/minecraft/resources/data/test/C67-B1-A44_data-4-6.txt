<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hello
<Architect> begin by placing 2 yellow blocks flat on the ground. place them near the center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> is this ok?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now place 2 more blocks vertically on top of the yellow block on the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> inverse L?
<Architect> yeah it's an inverse L. perfect. Now 2 more blocks to the right of the 2 blocks you just placed
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah that's fine. place 1 block in the corner
<Architect> the corner that isn't the L
<Architect> this structure is completely 2 dimensional
<Builder> oh in the intersection..
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> place 2 more blocks. 1 above the middle highest yellow, one above the right highest yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> remove that last block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> so you see that yellow block that's the highest? place a block to the right of it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> we're only building up from this point so don't worry about blocks undernearth
<Builder> here?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now switch to purple.
<Architect> looking at the structure, place 4 purple blocks each above the two highest yellow blocks. 8 purple blocks total
<Builder> two towers?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> of four blocks?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> place 2 more towers at the same elevation of the purple structure. 3 blocks tall this time instead of 2
<Architect> on the side
<Builder> which side?
<Architect> the sides of the purple structure
<Builder> oh so 4x4?
<Architect> yeah so like make a 4 by 4 but without the top left and top right corner blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah it works.
<Architect> 2 more purple blocks left place 1 5 spaces above the left most yellow blocks
<Architect> left-most yellow block*
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> that last block you placed is perfect
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now make the purple structure symetrical
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> ok we're done. sorry for the god awful instructions
<Builder> no worries
<Builder> good job
