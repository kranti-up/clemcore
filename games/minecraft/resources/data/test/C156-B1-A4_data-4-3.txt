<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi; this one is pretty complicated
<Architect> start with blue
<Architect> towards the edge
<Architect> place three on top of each other
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:5]
<Builder> anywhere is fine?
<Architect> yeah that's good; delete the bottom one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:5]
<Builder> done
<Architect> build one next to the top one
<Architect> towards the center
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> one on top of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> one more next to the newest one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> next to it not on top
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
<Architect> good
<Architect> you'll make that same structure two more times
<Architect> second one is almost directly above the first
<Builder> okay. what color?
<Architect> blue still; start in the middle column, build up three blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good; delete the middle one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4]
<Architect> the other middle one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:4]
<Architect> good; just make the same structure as below it
<Builder> okay
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now the third one is farther away
<Builder> still blue?
<Architect> look at the tip of the second "m"
<Architect> still blue
<Architect> two blank spaces towards the center then one space to the right
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> one more towards the center
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> good
<Architect> build a tower straight up
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> how big?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> there
<Builder> 7?
<Architect> it's hard to tell; the thing is just floating
<Builder> are the tops aligned?
<Architect> the third one's top is one taller than the second one
<Builder> by how much?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Architect> make the top of your tower the starting block then make the same structure
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-2]
<Architect> oops you added more
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> the top of your tower lines up with the middle row of the second "m"
<Builder> wait so the 7th block was the start right?
<Architect> yep
<Builder> so that should be okay?
<Architect> it needs to move down one space
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:9 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> is this okay?
<Architect> yes great
<Builder> good
<Architect> now switch to orange
<Architect> look at the shadows of two structures
<Architect> the one with four spaces
<Architect> move two spaces to the left
<Architect> on the opposite side of the third structure
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> in line with the four shadows
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> where should i stand?
<Architect> there is good
<Architect> leave two blank spaces, then place an orange block
<Architect> such that it lines up with the top of the shadows
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> great
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now build a tower straight up
<Architect> line up with the top of the second structure
<Builder> it might be easier to connect the stuctures from before?

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:2]
<Architect> there's no connection though
<Architect> build one more up
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:2]
<Architect> delete all but the top three
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:2]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> rotate 90 degrees and face the orange line
<Architect> okay; put three more orange blocks to the right of that
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:0]
<Architect> you're making a flat 3x3 square
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes; fill in any gaps below it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> great all done
<Builder> good
