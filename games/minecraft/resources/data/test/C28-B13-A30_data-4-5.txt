<Builder> does it matter if I place them near a corner?
<Architect> yes. try to make it near the center
<Architect> of an edge
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok then replicate that towards the center of the board leaving two spaces between those blocks
<Builder> two spaces between my current two purple blocks and the new ones I'm about to place?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> now build a platform out of yellow blocks on top of the purple blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> ok now on the edge of the long side of the platform place an overhanging yellow block one space from the corner
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> yes! now replicate that on the other side
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok now on the short edge closest to those 2 new blocks, build 2 yellow squares up in the middle
<Architect> not overhanging
<Builder> the two squares should be on top of each other?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> now place one more yellow block on the edge of the top block that you just placed and make it overhang
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> thats it
