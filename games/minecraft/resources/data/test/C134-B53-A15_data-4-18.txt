<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one's a rainbow ring
<Architect> start with a floating red block one tile above the center
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> now, an orange block one tile above and away from that
<Architect> any direction is fine, just not directly above
<Builder> gotcha
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> the position is good, but it should be orange
<Builder> Oops
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> two more orange blocks in the same trajectory :)
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> cool. now make a row of 3 yellow blocks on top of that, perpendicular
<Architect> to the rest of them*
<Builder> Centered?
<Architect> centered, yeah
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> now a row of 3 green bending upwards and back towards the red block in a staircase
<Builder> Should they mirror the orange blocks?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-2]
<Architect> no, sorry, the row of green should be parallel to the ywellow
<Architect> it's a weird ring
<Builder> I don't think I understand
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, start with 3 green blocks directly on top of the 3 yellow ones
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-3]
<Architect> put another row next to them, above the 2nd highest orange block
<Builder> Oh, so now we're building a staircase out of rows?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3]
<Architect> precisely!
<Builder> one more, yes?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> no not yet
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> Now what?
<Architect> the 2nd row should be one tile down
<Architect> at the same height as the first noe
<Architect> one*

<Architect> good! now make a row of blue in the same trajectory as the yellow and green
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1]

<Builder> Hopefully I understood that time
<Architect> perfect! and a row of purple directly adjacent, at the same height
<Builder> Adjacecnt to the left?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> yes, perfect!
<Architect> now that structure should be mirrored, starting with a row of blue next to the purple
<Builder> Ok, are all of the colors the same on the other side?
<Architect> so no more red or purple blocks
<Architect> yes :)
