<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is all in one vertical plane
<Architect> so you'll be building up. Start with two red blocks one space apart
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> somewhere in the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> on top of that a row of 7 forest green blocks.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> on top of both?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> not vertically, horizontally
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> and it will be symmetric
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and yeah@!!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> awesome. on top of that, 5 forest green blocks
<Builder> are we making a tree?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> kind of. do another layer of the tree (3) then it will change after that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> it kind of looks like a man in a skirt
<Architect> on top of that, three light/puke green blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> yup! and the same again
<Builder> the closest I have to that is the yellow i put down
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> that looks right
<Builder> alrighty
<Architect> color wise. now, 5 of the same color on top of that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yep! and finally, one red on top in the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> thats good!
<Builder> cool
