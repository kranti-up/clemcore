<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> alright, start with a 3x3 square of red on the ground near the center
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> okay, now, you're gonna want to make a 5x5 hollow ring around the square
<Architect> but one layer above it
<Architect> it should be orange
<Builder> Alright, I can do that
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> and remove the 4 corner blocks when you're done
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> Will do
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect! two green blocks on any two corners of the red square
<Architect> adjacent corners*
<Architect> not diagonals
<Builder> Should they be inside the orange ring?
<Architect> yes! same height as the orange ring, and inside it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> okay, from the right one, make a staircase of 4 green blocks total
<Architect> extending in the direction you're currently facing, and upwards
<Builder> I need more information
<Architect> yeah, sorry, i just realized that was unclear
<Builder> Is it a diagonal line?
<Architect> start with a green block on top of the orange one in front of the right green one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> on the same side as the other green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> on top of the other orange block touching the same green block
<Builder> Okay, so the one on the side furthest away from me?
<Architect> yes, sorry :(
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> Then continue the line?
<Builder> Diagonal line, I mean
<Architect> yeah, same trajectory, 4 blocks total
<Builder> Ok I understand
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:4 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect! do the same thing on the other side, except it's also diagonally away from the corner
<Builder> I see
<Architect> so the trajectory is forward, up, and left
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> and stop at 3 blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> Like so?
<Architect> perfect! all done i think. sorry for the confusion
<Builder> No worries
