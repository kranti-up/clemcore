<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello. Whats our mission this time?
<Architect> we have a difficult one ahead of us this time builder. bear with me
<Builder> describe the structure?
<Architect> we will start using red blocks. if you recall from our previous mission we built an open 3x3 square as the second level of our "table
<Architect> this shape is now extending upwards instead of laying flat
<Builder> okay
<Architect> sort of like a window
<Builder> can i build anywhere?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> yes i think that will work
<Architect> now please place a red block on the left and right sides of the window, in the middle of each side

<Architect> perfect
<Architect> the second half of this structure is the same using purple blocks, but oriented differently. i will attempt to start you off step by step though
<Builder> so parallel?
<Builder> or perpendicular?
<Architect> it is attached to our current structure sort of parallel and rotated 90 degrees. anyway please place the first purple block on the rightmost red block

<Architect> its as if they were laying side by side and the purple one gets tilted up 90 degrees so it faces the sky

<Builder> oh so its on the ground?
<Architect> we can start off with the first few blocks and you will see soon
<Architect> the first purple block needs to be attached to the rightmost block, so that it hangs in the air and is closer to you
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> if you move that block to the other side of that red block so that it is on your side and not just an extension
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> is this the arm of the window?
<Architect> nowplease make the open square (window) on top of that new purple block
<Architect> yes it is

<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> ok builder i have bad news but it's an easy fix
<Architect> i gave you the wrong side
<Builder> on the back or other side?
<Architect> if you could do that exact structure so that its on the left side of the red square from where you were standing it will be correct
