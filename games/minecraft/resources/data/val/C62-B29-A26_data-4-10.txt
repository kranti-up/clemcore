<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> We'll be building a lowercase h followed by a pi symbol
<Architect> The h will be red, consisting of a column of 4 red bricks, then one red brick floating, then two red bricks
<Architect> from left to right

<Architect> Great job!
<Builder> which color for pi?
<Architect> Now we'll make the pi. First, add a column of two bricks that are blue, adjacent to the right side of the h
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Then skip a space, and add another column of two blue bricks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Nice! now cap of the pi with 5 purple bricks
<Architect> cap off*
<Builder> will one be over the h?
<Architect> yes

<Architect> Great job! the h pi has depth two, so add the bricks necessary to make it have depth 2
<Builder> all the colors are the same?
<Architect> yep!
