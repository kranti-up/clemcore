<Architect> so this one is kind of like a truck or a dog or something
<Builder> ok. so four legs/wheels?
<Architect> yes, put four blue blocks on the corners of a 4x3 rectangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> now we're going to put a 5x3 red rectangle on top of that
<Architect> 6x3 actually
<Builder> ok. sticking out one on each side?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]

<Builder> thanks
<Architect> go to the left side and face the shape from there
<Architect> put a yellow on the leftmost red block and the rightmost
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and a green in the middle
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> now put 3 green blocks on top of those
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> those three green blocks are the side of a 3x3 square
<Architect> that sits on top of the red blocks
<Builder> that lays flat?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> filled in?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> face the front of the truck again
<Architect> and put three red blocks on top of the middle row
<Builder> I'll assume all polygons are filled in from now on
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> sorry green
<Builder> i'm out of red blocks
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]

<Architect> put orange behind the left and right of the blocks you just placed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes except i made a mistake. There's not green block between the two orange blocks on the bottom layer of the square
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ok, did I clean it up correctly?
<Architect> yes, i think that's it
