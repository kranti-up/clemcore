<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ready?
<Builder> good to go
<Architect> okay, so, you're gonna want to start by placing 5 orange blocks in a row near the center
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> yep! now, you're gonna build a 2d pyramid
<Builder> is that close enought
<Architect> yeah, it's fine
<Architect> so, two orange blocks on either end
<Builder> on top?
<Architect> yeah on top, sorry
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> it'll be a vertical pyramid
<Architect> and then two more blocks up and diagonally inwards from those two
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> and one more to complete it!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now move to the other side of the structure
<Architect> sorry, trying to figure out how to explain this
<Architect> okay, stand right there and face right
<Architect> put a green block three spaces in front of you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> now another on top of that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> now two green blocks on either side, paralell to the orange pyramid
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> whoops, my bad
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> those should both be connected to the top block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> alright, now two more green blocks extending to the right of the top row
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now remove the bottom block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and build the exact same pyramid structure on top of those green blocks
<Architect> so it should look like the orange one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Builder> is that good?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> okay, so now, place a red block on top and in front of the topmost green block, from your current perspective
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> no, sorry, the top of the pyramid
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:3]
<Architect> start with a red block on top of the pyramid
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
<Architect> like that, but on the other side!
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now extend that to a row of 5 red blocks, making a line towards the orange pyramid
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> okay, now, you're gonna want to build an UPSIDE DOWN pyramid structure
<Architect> so just like the other two, but upside down
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, perfect!
<Builder> solid
<Architect> i messed up though
<Architect> i apologized
<Architect> the orange pyramid should be one tile to the right of where it currently is, so it's directly underneath the red pyramid's ip
<Architect> tip*
<Builder> aight
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> no
<Architect> sorry
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> move one space left
<Architect> walk up against the orange pyramid
<Architect> okay, place an orange block right in front of you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and one space down
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> so underneath that
<Architect> yeah, that's the row you should rebuild the orange pyramid on
<Builder> okie dokie
