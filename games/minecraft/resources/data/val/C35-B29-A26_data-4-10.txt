<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> We'll start with 4 red bricks horizonal to one another
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> On top of the rightmost brick, add three orange bricks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> Now we'll add a diagonal of yellow bricks
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> the bottom one will be on top of the leftmost red brick
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> and the top one will be on the left of the orange brick
<Architect> So add a yellow brick on top of the leftmost red brick
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Please add another green diagonal directly on top of the red one
<Architect> Yellow* one
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Now we'll make a blue row that starts on top of the orange bricks and goes forward
<Architect> the row will have 4 blue bricks
<Builder> forward to my right or in front of me?
<Architect> So the last brick will be behind the structure
<Builder> behind relative to?
<Builder> my back?
<Architect> as in further from you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> great!
<Architect> Now we'll add a diagonal that conects that most recently placed blue brick to the bottom green brick
<Builder> which color?
<Architect> So one brick will touch the bottom right green brick
<Architect> Purple
