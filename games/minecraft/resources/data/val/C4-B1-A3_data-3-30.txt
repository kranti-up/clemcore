<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again builder
<Builder> hello
<Architect> we will start using green blocks
<Architect> i need you to build 4 green blocks straight from where you are standing, all on the ground
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now i need you to put a green block on either side of the second existing block, on the ground
<Builder> so on the middle blocks?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> they need to be attached to the same block, preferable to the one closer to you
<Architect> so it looks like a cross
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now, i need you to place a block diagonal from one of those new blocks, in the forward direction
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like a cactus?
<Architect> yes perfect
<Architect> now we are done with the green
<Architect> can you place a red block above the 4 greens with a space in between the green line and the new block?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> just need 1 block space in between the green and the new red block
<Builder> oh i see
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> yes like that
<Architect> now can you place 4 yellow blocks on each flat side of the red block?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> its a flower!
<Architect> yes it is, you are very observant builder
<Architect> to finish, we need 4 orange blocks to fill in the corners of the 3x3 head of the flower
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> good job builder, we have successfully completed our mission!
<Builder> good job!
