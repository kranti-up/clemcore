<Builder> no problem
<Architect> Now we'll be building broken heart object
<Builder> red?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Now on the next level we want red-blackspace-red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> what is a blackspace?
<Architect> Oh oops i meant blank space
<Builder> ok
<Architect> You did the right thing
<Architect> We'll do the same thing on the third level, so three blank spaces this time

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> Then remove the brick above the one just added
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! We have a heart. Now let's add a broken symbol
<Architect> First, we will add three brown bricks
<Builder> will orange do?
<Builder> I have no brown
<Architect> They will be diagonal down right through the heart
<Architect> That might do, let me ask
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> It is orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]

<Architect> Nice!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Builder> what else?
<Architect> We will now make a small L-shape with three orange bricks on the top
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> The L will be oriented so that the right angle is facing the diagonal of orange blocks

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice! you have the right structure and orientation, but the L should float one more level up and to the left
