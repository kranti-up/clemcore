<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> I think I'm ready to go pro at this
<Architect> haha
<Architect> ok we're building a 2d vertical drawing. start at the left column and build 3 yellow blocks. begin the drawing all the way to the left of the platform, and near the center
<Architect> instructions are kinda confusing I'll keep walking you through it
<Builder> this perspective?
<Architect> build a column of 3 yellow blocks. begin all the weay to left, center
<Architect> no stand still and look forward on the ground. it is a 2d veritcal drawing

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> ok that's the first column. good. next column is to the right of it. its yellow, empty, yellow

<Architect> empty 2 yellow
<Architect> empty 3 yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> completely empty
<Architect> empty blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> ok now we're making a blue key so rotate your view 90 degrees
<Architect> to the right
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> you rotated 90 to the left
<Builder> same design? just blue?
<Architect> not the same design
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> next column: empty 2 blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3]

<Architect> ok we're done good job
<Builder> go team
<Architect> I will use this format for communication on other 2d veritcal or horizontal drawings
