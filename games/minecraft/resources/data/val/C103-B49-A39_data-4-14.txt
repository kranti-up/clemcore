<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi
<Builder> hey
<Architect> so we're going to make a green chair thing
<Builder> ready
<Architect> first, put two green blocks on the ground with a space between them
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> one space?
<Architect> yup, that looks good
<Architect> behind them and in the middle of them, put another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> it should also have a blank space between these two and it though
<Architect> sorry, wasn't fast enough
<Architect> so move that one you placed backwards a space
<Builder> one more over?
<Architect> yeah
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> nice
<Architect> in the middle of all three of these blocks, on the layer above them, place another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like so?
<Architect> yup, exactly
<Architect> now make a 3x3 platform on top of that last block, centered at that block

<Builder> OK
<Architect> cool, that's the seat of the chair
<Architect> the back will be aligned with the row that is aligned with the one-block leg
<Builder> OK
<Architect> and it goes straight up by two blocks
