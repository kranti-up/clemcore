<Builder> hello architect
<Builder> i am born again
<Architect> rise my son
<Builder> i am ready to build father
<Architect> ok this thing looks kind of like a suspensionn bridge
<Builder> ok, my knowledge in engineering is limited so please use much detail
<Architect> okie dokie
<Architect> start with two red blocks along the side of the domain
<Builder> does it matter which side?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> no
<Architect> ok now you want to do that exactly opposite but one block in this time
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, now add a purple layer on top that connects the two bases

<Architect> great
<Architect> ok now we are going to make the bridge towers
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place an orange brick to the lower right corner of the left bottom red block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> yeah!
<Architect> ok put three more orange blocks on top
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> now cross over the top of the bridge with three more orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> these are attached to the top most orange block
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now build that down to the ground like on the other side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> shall we do the same on the other side of the bridge?
<Architect> we shall
<Builder> same color?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> great
<Builder> have we completed our goal?
<Architect> not yet
<Builder> standing by
<Architect> now we need to place a yellow block on top of the four orange posts
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> add yellow blocks on top and connect them across the bridge
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> wait
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> other way
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> basically like the orange ones
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah nice
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok now we need to build the suspension rigging
<Builder> ok i don't know what that means but i trust you architect
<Architect> start with red blocks
<Architect> place them next to the top yellow blocks on the posts so they are on the inside of the bridge
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> that wasn't clear sorry
<Builder> here?
<Architect> oh yeah great
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok we are going to need a placeholder block so use green or blue
<Builder> roger that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> cool, put it right below all of the red blocks you just added
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> great, now add another red block next to each green one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> yep
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> add another green block below each red one you added
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> then connect across with two red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> what a masterpiece!
<Builder> wait
<Builder> i think i messed up
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> lols yeah the one side is correct
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> yay!
<Builder> we good now?
<Architect> yep
<Builder> awesome!
