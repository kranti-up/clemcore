<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok, this is a complex type of build
<Architect> so we'll go plane by plane again
<Builder> aright
<Architect> just start in the center of the grid, put 2 purple blocks down
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> kk plane 1 done
<Architect> on the right purple block, put a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> plane 2 done
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> on top of the purple block, put another one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> plane 3 done
<Architect> on top of the purple block, put a blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> plane 4 done
<Architect> on top of the blue block, put another blue blocl
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> plane 5 done
<Architect> put another blue block on top
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> plane 6 done
<Architect> this is where it gets interesting
<Architect> first put down a blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> on the same plane facing you, leave a space and then put 2 red blocks down in a row
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> and the same thing on the other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> actually all 4 sides
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> the build is symmetric from here
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Architect> then an orange block on the left and right of each of the more inner red blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-3]
<Architect> perfect, plane 7 done
<Architect> ok, put a red block on top of the blue block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one on all 4 faces
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one outward from each red block you just put down
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> and then fill the gaps on that plane with 4 orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Architect> plane 8 done
<Architect> top it off with a red block and we done
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Architect> lit
