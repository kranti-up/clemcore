<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> you got it
<Architect> do that twice more
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> and then another red one below that
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> yep
<Architect> ok time to build the disease
<Builder> i am ready
<Architect> switch to orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and then do it again
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> yes actually
<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> and one under the second one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> now you can get rid of blue
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:8 Z:0]
<Architect> nice, that's it
