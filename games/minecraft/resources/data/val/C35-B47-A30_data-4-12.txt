[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok no on the end you are nearest to, build up 3 orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> and a blue block on top
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> ok no on the other end of the red row, build a yellow block on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
