<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> ok this one is not 2 dimensional so its gonna be a bit challenging
<Builder> got it
<Architect> but lets start with a 2 dimensional 2 column drawing anyways
<Architect> red, empty, yellow
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> anywhere
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Architect> ok I take that back place it in the middle
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> 2nd column: empty, orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok allow me some time to think of instructions
<Builder> it might be easier to describe all one color?
<Builder> then build from there?
<Architect> ok lets finish up the yellows then
<Architect> place one yellow a column to the right of the orange block, 1 space higher, and 1 space further back
<Builder> back meaning away?
<Builder> or towards me?
<Architect> into the page
<Architect> lol
<Architect> away yes
<Builder> away?
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> ok that's it
<Architect> ok lets do greens now
<Architect> place 1 green block a single space behind, and a single space above the yellow block you just placed
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yep
<Builder> here?
<Architect> if you could return to the front of the structure every time, it wouldh elp with the instructions I think
<Architect> the other green block is 3 spaces to the left and 1 space up of the last yellow block you placed
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yep
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> ok we're done with greens lets do blue
<Architect> thers a blue block 1 space above and 1 space away from the last green block you placed
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> the other blue block is 1 space to the left, 1 space up, 1 space behind the first green block you placed
<Architect> the left green block*
<Builder> diagonal step?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> remove that last blue one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> ok last is purple
<Architect> place a purple 1 space left, 1 space up of the last blue block you placed
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> ok we're done
<Builder> left step?
<Architect> would you like for me to start using those terms?
<Builder> just to confirm
<Architect> ah ok
