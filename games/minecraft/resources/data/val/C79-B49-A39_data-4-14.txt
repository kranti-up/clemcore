<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi!
<Builder> hi
<Architect> this entire thing floats in the air and consists of cross shaped structures
<Architect> start at an edge in the middle and place two green blocks stacked on top of each other
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Architect> actually, make that 4
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> remove the bottom one
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> on the left and right sides of the middle block, place another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> on the back side of that middle green block, put a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> extend that to make a row of 5 blocks coming towards you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> this is part of a 5x5 yellow cross, so you can fill in the rest
<Builder> i thought you said it was floating
<Architect> oh, yeah
<Architect> the sides go out to the left and right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> it's a centered cross when looking top down
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok i think
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> at the end of that yellow cross that's closest to you right now, put an orange block towards you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> then put a blue block to the left of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> the blue block is the right end of a cross that looks exactly like the green one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the orange block is going to be part of the only cross that isn't centered
<Architect> so more of a holy cross i guess?
<Architect> put another three oranges to its right
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> on the second to rightmost orange block, we'll put one block on each of its sides, such that it is laying flat like the yellow cross
<Builder> orange?
<Architect> yup
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> beautiful
<Architect> we've finished the cross montage
<Builder> nice!
