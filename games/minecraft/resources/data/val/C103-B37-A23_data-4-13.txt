<Builder> hi!
<Architect> you'll need only green blocks. we are making a chair
<Builder> ok, sounds good
<Architect> okay, go ahead and place a green block down in teh cetner of the palte
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> whoa sorry bad typing.
<Builder> ha no worries
<Architect> okay, now leaving a gap space, place another block in the row you are standing in.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> so you are going to move two rows over
<Builder> ok
<Architect> and place a block on the same row as the gap. Kind of making a triangle
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> place a stack of two in the middle
<Builder> the middle of all 3 blocks?
<Architect> yes.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> remove the bottom block of the stack
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> add another block to the top of the highest block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> then, add one block to every side of that block, not including the top side
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> So finish off by making that cross a sqaure by filling in the corners. like the seat of a chair
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> go to the side of the chair where the top iof the triangle base is.
<Architect> yes
<Architect> on that side, on top of the chair seat, build a chair back two blocks tall.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> Done!
<Builder> great!
