<Architect> Hmm, should move the blue block closest to you so it is on the left side, away from the purple structure
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> Like this?
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Okay now another row of two blue on top of that one

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
<Architect> Also blue
