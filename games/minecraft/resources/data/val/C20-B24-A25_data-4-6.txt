<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
<Architect> first, put a red block down
<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
<Architect> from the one ur looking at
<Architect> yea that works
<Architect> so the red block goes there
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
<Builder> lol
<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk
<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> k
<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
<Builder> gotchu
<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
<Architect> just a single block
<Architect> that's just its position
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> yup
<Builder> my b
<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
<Architect> above both
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> yup
<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
<Architect> let's backtrack
<Builder> aright
<Architect> should be easy to fix,
<Architect> can u go on the other side
<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
<Builder> kk
<Architect> ok, plane 3
<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> yup
<Architect> and then move the purple one back
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> should share an edge with the blue block on the right
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> we done
<Builder> sweet
<Architect> sorry about that, switching sides threw me off at some point i guess
