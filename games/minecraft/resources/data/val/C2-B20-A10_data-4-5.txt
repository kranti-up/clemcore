<Architect> so this one is a flaoting structure. start with a square (2 by 2 ) in the center
<Builder> colour?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> doesn't matter, you'll be removing them to get the structure to float

<Builder> alrighty
<Architect> the next layer up is similar in that you're building on the perimeter with purple blocks
