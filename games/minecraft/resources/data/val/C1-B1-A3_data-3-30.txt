<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello. what are we building this time?
<Architect> hello builder, i will tell you this. it appears we are creating a belltower. but first i will start with step by step instructions. we will start with green blocks
<Architect> please start with 8 green blocks extending straight up. this will need to be placed as far right as you can, preferably centered along the other axis

<Architect> good job builder. if you can do this without a supporting structure then please do. we need yet another row of purple blocks that is 9 long so that it lays across the green and red, on top of them
