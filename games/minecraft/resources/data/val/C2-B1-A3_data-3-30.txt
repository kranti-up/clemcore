<Builder> go it
<Architect> good job builder. i need a moment to inspect the structure.
<Architect> we will be removing this first layer in the future, but we need to build on top of it first.
<Architect> please place 2 red blocks on top of each side of the square, leaving the corners empty

<Architect> perfect.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> there is a 3rd layer that is floating, so please made a 6x6 square that extends upwards of 2 blocks to support the 3rd layer
<Architect> these will use purple blocks
<Builder> can you give me an instruction for a single purple block first?
<Architect> how about this, please make a 6x6 purple ring around the first layer of the red square
<Builder> okay

<Architect> yes, awesome. now place add another layer to that ring
<Architect> please*
<Builder> purple?
<Builder> i am out of blocks
<Architect> oh, do you have any colors that are not purple or red?
<Builder> yes
<Architect> ok, my mistake. i am a failure of an architect
<Architect> we will use other colors to support the final structure
<Builder> is the purple supposed to be on the third level?
<Builder> i think i could make it float..
<Architect> let's use blue to replace the purple ring. yes purple is supposed to be the final structure
<Builder> okay
<Builder> let me try it
