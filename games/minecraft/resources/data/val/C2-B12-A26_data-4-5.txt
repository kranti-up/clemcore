<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay, we'll start with a 2x2x2 cube of red bricks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> One the next level, we'll add a ring of red blocks, so that the 2nd layer is a 4x4 square of red bricks

[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Good work! now add purple bricks on top of each of the red bricks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> Complete the perimeter of the 4x4 square the purple blocks are almost making
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> Awesome! Now add two purple bricks to the side of each of the perimeter
<Builder> I am not sure what you mean
<Builder> make it into an octogon?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> So that we will have a blank-purple-purple-blank on each side of the square
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Nice!

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> The last step will be to remove the purples that are on top of the red, but you already did that
