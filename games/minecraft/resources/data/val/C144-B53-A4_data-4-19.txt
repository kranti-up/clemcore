<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello. let's start with purple
<Architect> go toward an edge and build a big P
<Architect> column of five
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> then finish a 3x3 square using the top of that column
<Builder> Along the edge?
<Architect> in toward the middle
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> greaat
<Builder> P
<Architect> now red
<Architect> there's a block in that crook under the P
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> now one diagonal down to the right from that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> then one to the right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> then one up and diagonal right
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> then another same pattern
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> So here first?
<Architect> sorry just another diagonal and right
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> So this
<Architect> yep. now spin 90 degrees to face the P head on
<Architect> build one red diagonal up and right from that one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> then one digonal down left
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> from teh last one you placed
<Architect> sorry it's still to the right
<Architect> directions are hard
<Builder> Yeah, was confused about that
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> now an orange block under the last one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> now two orange blocks diagonal on the surface. the first one is down left and toward you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> Here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now one left and toward you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> excellent. that's it
