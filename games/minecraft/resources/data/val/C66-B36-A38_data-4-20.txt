<Builder> let's do it
<Architect> Ok, somewhere in the middle and off to the left, make a line of orange blocks that is 5 long. It should be parrallel to the edge in front of you

<Architect> No worries, that's perfect
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Can you make stairs going up from the two edges?
<Builder> sure
<Architect> To complete the triangle

<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Yup.
<Architect> let's getr started on the red triangle.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> If you look at the right side of the orange triangle, you should see the 2nd block from the ground, right?
<Builder> here?
<Architect> One up and to the right of that, we will put a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Sorry, it should be as if you made a stair coming from the orange triangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ooooo

<Builder> my right?
<Architect> Now your left, sorry.
<Builder> o its ok
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah, if you stand right next to it.
<Architect> you will need to puit a block above your head

<Architect> Perfecty
<Builder> ok
<Architect> The red triangle is upside down and is perpendicular to the orange triangle
<Builder> oooo
<Builder> ok
<Architect> We are going to make the stairs going up to the two sides of the red block. They should be two blocks long
<Builder> ok
