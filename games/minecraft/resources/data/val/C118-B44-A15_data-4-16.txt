<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello. ready
<Architect> hello!
<Architect> okay, so it looks like we're building an X shaped thing
<Architect> start by putting an orange block near the middle of the grid
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and stack another one on top
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then remove the bottom one
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> alright, put one orange block on both sides of the current one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then extend each side by one orange block towards you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yep! now from each of those, build outward again
<Architect> to the sides
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and repeat that pattern again on each side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and one more off each side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> oops, one block too many. get rid of the last one you put down on each side
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, now, delete the second block from the left on the left side
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep! and delete the third block from the left on the left side, so you have a diagonal line from the row of 3
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now make the right side mirror the left. so delete the same two blocks
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, cool! now stack a row of 3 red blocks on top of the row of 3 orange
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> and put 3 more red blocks directly behind those 3
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> and now delete the first row of red that you put down
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> good! almost done!
<Architect> on top of the ends of the row of red blocks, place one more red block each
<Builder> do I repeat the thing I did with orange but on red?
<Architect> no, it's a little different
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> sorry, i meant on top, so stack them
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> good! and now extend those one block outwards on either side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> okay, now delete the two on top of the bottom row
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect! i think we're done! :)
<Builder> nice
