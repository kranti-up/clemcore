When placed horizontally, its sides are labeled 'left' and 'right'; vertically, they're 'top' and 'bottom'. For a horizontal bridge, the left and right sides occupy the same row, but adjacent columns. For a vertical bridge, the top and bottom sides are in the same column, but consecutive rows.\n\nIn the grid, columns align with the x-axis and rows with the y-axis. Python indexing is used to identify each cell. The cell in the top-left corner is in the first row and first column, corresponding to x and y values of 0, 0. Similarly, the top-right corner cell is in the first row and eighth column, with x and y values of 0, 7.\n\n- Use the shape name 'bridge-h' if a bridge is placed horizontally\n- Use the shape name 'bridge-v' if a bridge is placed vertically\n\nThe following functions are already defined; therefore, do not generate additional code for it\n- Use `put(board: np.ndarray, shape: string, color: string, x: int, y: int) to place a shape on the board\n\nFor each instruction labeled Instruction please respond with code under the label Output followed by a newline.\n\nInstruction\nplace a red washer in the 1st row, 7th column\n\nOutput\nput(board, shape='washer', color='red', x=0, y=6)\n\nInstruction\nplace a blue nut in the 3rd row, 1st column\n\nOutput\nput(board, shape='nut', color='blue', x=2, y=0)\n\nInstruction\nplace a green screw in the 5th row, 7th column\n\nOutput\nput(board, shape='screw', color='green', x=4, y=6)\n\nInstruction\nplace a yellow bridge horizontally in the 7th row, 5th column\n\nOutput\nput(board, shape='bridge-h', color='yellow', x=6, y=4)\n\nInstruction\nplace a red bridge vertically in the 4th row, 3rd column\n\nOutput\nput(board, shape='bridge-v', color='red', x=3, y=2)\n\nDo not generate any other text/explanations.\n\nEnsure the response can be executed by Python `exec()`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no periods, etc.\n\nLets begin\n", "rows": 8, "cols": 8}]}]}
