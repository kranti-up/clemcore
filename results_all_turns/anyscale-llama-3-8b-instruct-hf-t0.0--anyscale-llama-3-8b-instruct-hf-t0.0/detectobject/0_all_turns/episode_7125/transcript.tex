	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you help me find a good quality coat with a plain pattern?\\ \tt System: I've got several for you to check out. There's a grey one on the left, the fourth one in on the bottom row. The fifth coat on that row is a brown one. I also have a black on the right center rack, about halfway in.\\ \tt User: I'm actually interested in finding something more like the grey coat in color and customer rating.\\ \tt System: The only other option like that is the sixth coat on the left bottom row. It's also grey.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 22, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 10, sweater, dark yellow, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: There's nothing else you can show me?
