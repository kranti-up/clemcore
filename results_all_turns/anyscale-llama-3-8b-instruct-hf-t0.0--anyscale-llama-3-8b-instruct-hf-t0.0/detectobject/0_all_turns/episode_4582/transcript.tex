	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do any of the hats have a good customer history?\\ \tt System: The black and orange one on the right side of this front cabinet has a good rating, as does the white one to the left of it.\\ \tt User: The blue jacket on this left clothing rack and the grey one on the clothing rack all the way in the back on the right... can you tell me about them, please?\\ \tt System: The one in the back is only available in size XS. The one in the front has sizes S, M, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt User: Sorry, what were the sizes of the one on this left rack?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, but I'm not certain which one you mean.\\ \tt User: The blue jacket that's on the left circular rack, not too far away from me.\\ \tt System: That one is available in small, medium, extra large, and two X. It's shown here in size small.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 61, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 94, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Are any of the jackets rated well?
