	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you see any small hoodies?\\ \tt System: There's a brown one on either side and a blue one on the upper left you might like.\\ \tt User: I'll take one of each of those teal ones instead.\\ \tt System: Okay. I've added them to your cart.\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?\\ \tt System: How about the blue hoodie on the bottom left?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 12, jacket, dark green, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 5, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt 3, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 1, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What sizes are the brown one on the right and the blue one up top? And how much are they?
