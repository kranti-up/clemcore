Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Any of these jeans worth taking a look at?\nSystem: I recommend you consider the two pairs in the middle of that set of shelves.\nUser: I want something in the same color as that grey pair, but can you get me something with high ratings?\nSystem: Actually, those grey jeans have favorable reviews.\nUser: I'd still like to see some more options.\nSystem: Unfortunately, I cannot find any more for you.
