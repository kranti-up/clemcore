	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Any of these jeans worth taking a look at?\\ \tt System: I recommend you consider the two pairs in the middle of that set of shelves.\\ \tt User: I want something in the same color as that grey pair, but can you get me something with high ratings?\\ \tt System: Actually, those grey jeans have favorable reviews.\\ \tt User: I'd still like to see some more options.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I cannot find any more for you. Is there something else I can assist you with today?\\ \tt User: I'd also like to know if there are any highly rated hoodies in small.\\ \tt System: That green hoodie hanging over the blue jeans meets your wishes.\\ \tt User: Wow that grey and white spotted tank top on the left looks very stylish. I'd like that in my cart please.\\ \tt System: I will add it to your cart right away.\\ \tt User: Do you think you might be able to find some good grey pants on this side?\\ \tt System: How about the pair in the middle of those other two grey pants?\\ \tt User: Huh, that grey coat towards the left sure looks nice. I guess I'm just really into grey today. Find me a grey coat just like it that has excellent reviews.\\ \tt System: That grey coat is all I can find, sorry.\\ \tt User: In that case, just show me whatever other coats you've got.\\ \tt System: Could I interest you in the black one hanging on the far right?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 62, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 56, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 4, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 10, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to hear what sizes both of those are made in.
