Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any couches made by Global Voyager?\nSystem: I have one, it's the gray sofa on the striped rug facing away from us.\nUser: How about something in wood?\nSystem: I don't seem to have anything like that.  Could I help you  look for something else instead?\nUser: How about showing me any expensive tables you have.\nSystem: On the right side of the room, I have the wooden table, which is expensive.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n5, Sofa, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Thank you for showing me.  I think I'll go with the gray sofa you showed me.
