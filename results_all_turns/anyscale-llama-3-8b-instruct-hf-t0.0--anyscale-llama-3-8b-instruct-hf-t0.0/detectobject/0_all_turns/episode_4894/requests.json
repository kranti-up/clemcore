Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are there any jeans around here that you would approve of?\nSystem: Those grey jeans in the very back to the left and the dark blue jeans on the right would both be wise purchases.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.

I can't stop looking at the dark green one next to the black and orange cap on the left, and I'm also really digging that first camo option on the right. Can I have you get me the sizes of those?
