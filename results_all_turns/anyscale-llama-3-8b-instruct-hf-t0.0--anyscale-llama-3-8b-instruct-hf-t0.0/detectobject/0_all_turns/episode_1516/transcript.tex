	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please show me some sweaters.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the red and white sweater on the bottom row?\\ \tt User: What is the size of the brown and blue jackets?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: I am referring to the brown jacket on the top right row and the blue jacket on the bottom left row.\\ \tt System: The brown jacket is in size XL and the blue jacket is in size L.\\ \tt User: Are there any t-shirts with half length sleeves you recommend?\\ \tt System: There is a brown t-shirt you might like.\\ \tt User: Any other recommendations?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no.\\ \tt User: Add the red and white sweater to my cart. Also the brown jacket.\\ \tt System: Okay, they will be added.\\ \tt User: Now tell me of any coat that will go with the rest of my wardrobe.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the black coat?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 4, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 33, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add it to my cart.
