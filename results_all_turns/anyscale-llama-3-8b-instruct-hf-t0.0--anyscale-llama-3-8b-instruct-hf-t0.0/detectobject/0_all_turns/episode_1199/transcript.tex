	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. I'm looking for a large blouse today.\\ \tt System: We have something you may be interested in. Take a look at the grey, white blouse on the right side.\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but we don't have any other blouses. Is there something else I can find for you?\\ \tt User: No problem. I'll take the black sweater and violet tshirt.\\ \tt System: OK. I will add those to your cart.\\ \tt User: Next, do you happen to have a good green sweater?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the green sweater on the table?\\ \tt User: I'll take one of the green sweaters.\\ \tt System: Sure. I will add that.\\ \tt User: And do you have good shirts?\\ \tt System: We do. What do you think of the brown, grey, or violet tshirts on the table?\\ \tt User: How much is the violet one?\\ \tt System: Which one are you referrring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 54, tshirt, violet, XXL\\ \tt 48, sweater, green, S\\ \tt 75, shirt, violet, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I mean the violet tshirt you recommended.
