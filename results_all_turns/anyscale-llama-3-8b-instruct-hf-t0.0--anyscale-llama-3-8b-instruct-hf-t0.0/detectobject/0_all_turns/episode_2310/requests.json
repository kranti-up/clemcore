Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Any good coats around?\nSystem: How about the light grey coat below the red shoeboxes, the brown coat in the alcove to the right of the blue jacket, or the black coat under the blue shoeboxes on the left?\nUser: Add the light grey one and the black one to my cart.\nSystem: Okay, I'll add those two coats to your cart.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
