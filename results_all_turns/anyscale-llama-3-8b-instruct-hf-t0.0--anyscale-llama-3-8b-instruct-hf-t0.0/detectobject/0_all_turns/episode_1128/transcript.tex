	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Yo, what dresses ya got?\\ \tt System: I have three that might interest you. The maroon dress on the rack to the left, the red dress on the middle rack, and the beige dress on that same rack. What do you think?\\ \tt User: Got anything else to show that's sleeveless?\\ \tt System: Sure, the black and olive dress on the middle rack, next to the beige dress, could work. If not that, the two purple dresses on the left rack might be more your type.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 49, dress, black, L\\ \tt 37, dress, black, olive, XS\\ \tt 58, dress, beige, M\\ \tt 44, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 40, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 46, jacket, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually, what's the price comparison between the black and olive dress on the left rack and the black dress on the middle rack?
