Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I wonder if you can find a respectable chair from Home Store?\nSystem: How does that beautiful green one in the back right suit you?\nUser: Can I see more please?\nSystem: Sorry, that is the only Home Store chair I can identify.\nUser: Got it. Maybe I'll have better luck with a sofa?\nSystem: I have two sofas to show you. Are you receptive to that grey one in the very back or the long red sofa on the white lined rug?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n4, EndTable, black, NA\n7, CouchChair, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh, that beige chair to the right of the lined rug is just flawless.
