	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any coats you can recommend?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey coat on the back bottom row?\\ \tt User: Show me items that have a similar sleeve length.\\ \tt System: Sorry, that is the only match.\\ \tt User: Is there anything else you can recommend?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no. What else can I help you with?\\ \tt User: Show me some sweaters?\\ \tt System: There are several sweaters on the table.\\ \tt User: Add the maroon, white, and blue blouse on the top row along the wall to my cart, as well as the white and blue shirt on the table.\\ \tt System: They will both be added to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 77, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 76, shirt, white, blue, S\\ \tt 71, sweater, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Now, is there a black coat which you can show me?
