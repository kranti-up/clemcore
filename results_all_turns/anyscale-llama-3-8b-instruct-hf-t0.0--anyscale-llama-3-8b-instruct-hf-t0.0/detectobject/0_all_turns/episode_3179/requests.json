Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which blouse here would fit in with what I already have?\nSystem: I would like to show you three blouses. Going from right to left, look at the maroon, white, and blue one, the red, white, and yellow one, and the black one.\nUser: Do you have anything else in maroon, white, and blue, but at an inexpensive price?\nSystem: Unfortunately, that blouse is the only one in these colors.\nUser: I see. Which pants here will fit my current style best?\nSystem: You may like three pairs. Going from right to left, consider the three grey pairs.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
