Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Please help me figure out if any of these blouses are good.\nSystem: Would you consider the long-sleeve black one hanging to the left, the black one on the shelves next to the pink sweater, or the long-sleeve grey and white blouse one shelf to the right?\nUser: Wait who makes those two pairs of jeans on the left?\nSystem: The jeans on the very end are made by Modern Arts. The lighter pair is made by Yogi Fit.\nUser: I want both of them. Place them in my cart please!\nSystem: Okay! I will put both of those jeans in your cart.\nUser: Now I'd really like to find something by Pedals & Gears.\nSystem: Sadly, there do not seem to be any options by that brand. What else can I do for you today?\nUser: Just show me whatever else you suggest.\nSystem: Unfortunately, I do not have any more suggestions as far as blouses are concerned.\nUser: Oh, well in that case let's look for jackets.\nSystem: Can I get your opinion on that solid brown jacket hanging above the pair of light-wash jeans?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
