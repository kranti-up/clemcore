Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new coat, do you have something that would match the rest of my closet?\nSystem: I do! How do you feel about these? I have a black coat on the back of the front floor rack, another black coat on the upper right, and a brown coat towards the far end of the left wall.\nUser: Those look promising! Could you compare sizing on that brown coat and the black coat on the wall?\nSystem: Of course! The brown coat is shown in size XL and the black one in size L.\nUser: Alright, thanks so much! Could you also recommend some jeans to match my closet?\nSystem: Of course! Take a look at these. I have some grey jeans on the bottom right, another pair of grey jeans on the left wall, second from the left, and a pair of dark blue jeans to the right of those.\nUser: I'll think about those, but for now I'll just grab that black coat on the wall.\nSystem: Ok, I'll go ahead and stick that in your cart for you.\nUser: On second thought, make that two.\nSystem: Of course! I've updated the amount in your cart.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
