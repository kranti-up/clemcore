Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello! I need a hat to complete my street style look. Maybe something with words?\nSystem: Sure! How do you feel about the grey one on the left side of the table or the other grey one farther to the right?\nUser: Hmm, they look pretty similar, could you tell me how they are reviewed and their sizes?\nSystem: Yes, the left one is a size S and is has a 3.8 review. The one on the right is a size S and is reviewed at 3.8.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n25, hat, grey, S\n20, hat, grey, S\n23, trousers, grey, XS\n18, trousers, grey, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok, what a shame, they're too small. Can we look at trousers instead? Maybe like the grey one under the black coat or the other grey one to the left of those? Definitely has to be an XS."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-a687b30c-d7c8-4acf-8c3f-9c6ecae834bd", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n23\n18", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715915409, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 7, "prompt_tokens": 400, "total_tokens": 407}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 03:10:08.998776", "call_duration": "0:00:00.998877", "response": "ObjectID\n23\n18", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
