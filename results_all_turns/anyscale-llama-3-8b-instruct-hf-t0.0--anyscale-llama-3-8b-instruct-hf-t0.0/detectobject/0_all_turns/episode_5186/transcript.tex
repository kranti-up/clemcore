	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets with full sleeves and good reviews?\\ \tt System: How about the grey one under the blue shoeboxes, the grey and white one on the rack on the right, or maybe the blue one on the right of that same rack?\\ \tt User: Anything else?\\ \tt System: I also have a light grey jacket on the left hand rack, a light grey jacket on the front of that rack, and a blue jacket.\\ \tt User: I'd like something like the blue one and the grey one on the back rack in price and reviews but in grey with a plain pattern.\\ \tt System: That grey jacket, as well as the one under the shoeboxes, fits that description.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 51, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 52, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Okay, add one of each of those to my cart.
