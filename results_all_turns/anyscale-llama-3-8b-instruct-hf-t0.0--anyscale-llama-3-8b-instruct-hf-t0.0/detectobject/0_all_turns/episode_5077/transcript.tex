	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have some hats I can see?\\ \tt System: Here are some that might interest you.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me how these blue pants compare with the grey ones?\\ \tt System: The blue jeans are made by Pedals and Gears and come in xs, s, l and xxl. They have an average rating of 3.4 and cost 239.99. The stripy grey pants come in xs and s only from Vegan Baker. They have an average rating of 3.5 and cost 244.99.\\ \tt User: Do you have any expensive coats?\\ \tt System: How do you feel about these options?\\ \tt User: Please add the grey pants and the white hat to my cart.\\ \tt System: I will add those to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 63, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 52, hat, white, M\\ \tt 8, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you throw the blue pants and the grey coat in too?
