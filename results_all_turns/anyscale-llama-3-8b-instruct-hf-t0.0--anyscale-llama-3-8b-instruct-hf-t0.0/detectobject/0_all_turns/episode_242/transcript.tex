	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some blouses that match everything?\\ \tt System: Do you like the grey and white one on the center front rack, the white and red one on the rack behind it, or the maroon one on the same rack?\\ \tt User: I'd look at full sleeved coats also.\\ \tt System: Do you like the brown one on the front rack or the black one on the same rack? They are both full sleeved coats.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the grey and white blouse with the maroon and white blouse for me?\\ \tt System: The grey and white blouse is by Nature Photographers and is available in XS, M, L, and XL. The maroon and white blouse is by Global Voyager and is available in S, L, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt User: Can you show me something like that brown hoodie on the center rack but with long sleeves?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in grey with a good rating?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have any hoodies like that right now.\\ \tt User: Can you show me coats made by Downtown Stylists then?\\ \tt System: I can show you coats by Downtown Stylists. Do you like the brown one hanging in the second cubby from the right?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 49, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 72, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 50, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the ratings of the maroon and white blouse and the grey and white blouse?
