Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm here to see jackets.\nSystem: There's two nice jackets, one in black and the other in brown, hanging at the very end of this wall on the left. There's also a great brown option in the very back on the left end of the top row. Are any of those close to what you were picturing?\nUser: That brown jacket at the end of the top row on the left is almost perfect. I want something in that size by that brand, but I was hoping for strong customer reviews and short sleeves.\nSystem: My apologies, but there are no short-sleeved jackets with high ratings in that size by the same brand.\nUser: Well that's a let-down. Oh well. I'd like to know the sizes of those two hoodies please.\nSystem: Woops, it isn't clear which hoodies you're talking about. Could you be more specific?\nUser: The two green ones. There's one on the rack up front to the right and another hanging down low in the very back.\nSystem: Both of those green hoodies are smalls.\nUser: Maybe I should have given that brown hoodie in the back a closer look. What distinguishes it from this brown one up front on the left?\nSystem: Both of those hoodies hanging up have an average customer rating of 3.5.\nUser: What else can you tell me about them? They almost seem like the same jacket.\nSystem: Both of those hoodies are made by Coats & More.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
