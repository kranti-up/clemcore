Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have a good table from Modern Arts?\nSystem: Take a look at the brown table in the last display in this room on the right.\nUser: OK. What other highly-rated tables in color brown do you have?\nSystem: I am sorry, I don't have any other highly-rated brown tables from Modern Arts.\nUser: That's OK. I would also like to see a sofa chair from Downtown Stylists, if it's reasonably priced.\nSystem: I don't have any pieces with these characteristics today.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
