	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What jeans in this room would fit the clothes I already own?\\ \tt System: For jeans, I have the dark-blue pair on the right and the light-blue pair  second from the right in the middle cupboard.\\ \tt User: OK. Can you also tell me what sizes are in stock for the green hoodie on the floor rack on our immediate right and the brown one in the second shelf from th right in the furthest rack? Also, what do they cost?\\ \tt System: Of course! The green hoodie comes in S, M, and L and costs 114.99. The brown one  comes in S, XL, and XXL and costs 144.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 65, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 2, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Nice! I will take one of each.
