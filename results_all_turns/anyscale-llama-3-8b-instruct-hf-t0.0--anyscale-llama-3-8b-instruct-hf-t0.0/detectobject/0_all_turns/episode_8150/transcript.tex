	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any hoodies you can show me?\\ \tt System: How about the brown hoodie on top in the middle?\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar in size and brand to the grey jacket on the bottom and the dark green/dark blue one to the left?\\ \tt System: There are two dark green/dark blue jackets on the left. What do you think?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 6, jacket, dark green, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 0, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the size and ratings for the blue jackets on either end of the top row against the wall?
