	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like you to show me some affordable jackets, but please only show me the ones with good ratings.\\ \tt System: In the third cabinet, I have the brown jacket at the far left.\\ \tt User: Can I get the price of that brown jacket?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt User: The one at the far left of that cabinet that you showed me.\\ \tt System: It costs 49.99.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything with a similar rating to that, but in L?\\ \tt System: I've got that jacket itself, the third brown jacket in that cabinet, and the gray and white one in the second cabinet.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 60, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 59, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 38, jacket, brown, L\\ \tt 2, coat, black, L\\ \tt 5, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 79, blouse, white, black, red, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: And which one do you think would look best on me?
