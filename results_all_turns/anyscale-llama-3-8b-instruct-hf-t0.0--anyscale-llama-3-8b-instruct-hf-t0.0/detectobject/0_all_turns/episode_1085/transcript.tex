	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any plain jackets that you can recommend?\\ \tt System: There are several, including a brown jacket and a blue jacket.\\ \tt User: Refine the brand for only products from HairDo.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no items match your current criteria.\\ \tt User: Okay, then just get me the size and brand of the blue jacket.\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt User: I am referring to the blue jacket on the wall.\\ \tt System: It is from Global Voyager and comes in S.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like it but in XS?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no. What else can I do for you?\\ \tt User: Compare on the price the violet dresses, please.\\ \tt System: Both are 244.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 46, dress, violet, XL\\ \tt 26, dress, violet, XL\\ \tt 58, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 10, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Okay, now pull up a sweater for me.
