	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some plain pants.\\ \tt System: I can help you find plain pants. I have the brown ones against the wall in the back and the blue pair next to it.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the ratings and brands for each of those?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The brown pair against the wall and the blue pair next to it.\\ \tt System: The brown pair is rated 3.6 and is by River Chateau. The blue pair is rated 3.4 and is by Pedals & Gears.\\ \tt User: Can you compare those two pairs of pants for me?\\ \tt System: The blue pair is by Pedals & Gears and is XXL. The brown pair is by River Chateau and is XS. Both are plain.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 7, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like some jeans with good ratings.
