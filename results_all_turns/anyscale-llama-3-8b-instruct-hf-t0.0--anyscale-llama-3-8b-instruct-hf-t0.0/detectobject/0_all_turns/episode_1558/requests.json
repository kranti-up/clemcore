Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me find a long-sleeved sweater?\nSystem: What do you think of the grey and black sweater on the middle shelf, the green on the bottom, and the red on the top?\nUser: Anything from Glam Nails?\nSystem: I have the grey sweater on the middle shelf.
