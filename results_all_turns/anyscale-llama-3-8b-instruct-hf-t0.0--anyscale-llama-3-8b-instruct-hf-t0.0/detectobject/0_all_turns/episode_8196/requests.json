Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Do you have more like it?\nSystem: Similar items are the light grey coat on the wall, the brown one behind it, and the grey coat on the front of the rack.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
