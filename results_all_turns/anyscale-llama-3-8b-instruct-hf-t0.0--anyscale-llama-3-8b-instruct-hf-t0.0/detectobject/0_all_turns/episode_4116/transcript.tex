	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have some XXL size tousers?\\ \tt System: I have one pair on the bottom left and another on the bottom right. Do you like either of them?\\ \tt User: I like them both, please add them to my cart.\\ \tt System: I'll do that right away.\\ \tt User: I need a  hoodie with full length sleeves.\\ \tt System: I have these two above the other two, what do you think?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 10, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 5, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 0, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What sizes are available for each?
