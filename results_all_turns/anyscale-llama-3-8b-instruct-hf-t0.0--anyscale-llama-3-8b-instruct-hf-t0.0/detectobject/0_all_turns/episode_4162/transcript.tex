	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any decent short-sleeve dresses in medium around here?\\ \tt System: I've got a black one in the back left next to that spunky multicolored knit top, another black one towards the back of that second circle rack on the floor, and a third black option on the circle rack closest to you.\\ \tt User: I like the one on the first rack best, but I'm not sure I'm totally in love with it. Are there any other options like it?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, there are no dresses similar to that one.\\ \tt User: I'm thinking it might be time to branch out a bit. Can you try to find something sleeveless in a camo print instead?\\ \tt System: Sadly, there are no dresses like that for sale. Is there anything else I can do for you?\\ \tt User: Let's take a break from the dresses I guess. I might want to buy that black jacket hanging over the grey pants on the right. Hm and the blue one on that rack in the back looks good too. Which of those is more highly rated? And it would be helpful to know what sizes they come in.\\ \tt System: The blue jacket carries a higher rating of 4.8. The black jacket, in comparison, is rated a 4.0. The blue jacket is available in small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large, while the black jacket is only available in small and extra large.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 27, dress, black, XL\\ \tt 7, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 21, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 30, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually wait that red and white plaid blouse is what has been missing from my wardrobe! Be a dear and add that to my cart please.
