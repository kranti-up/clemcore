	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see some long sleeve tops please.\\ \tt System: I've got the black one at the far left of the wall, the black one in the second cabinet from the left, and the gray and white one in the third cabinet.\\ \tt User: Have you got any long-sleeve tops similar to the gray and white one?\\ \tt System: There's the two black tops you already saw, as well as that gray and white top itself.\\ \tt User: Have you got any blazers made by North Lodge?\\ \tt System: At the far right of the third cabinet, I have that black blazer, and another one in the far right cabinet.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, blouse, white, grey, S\\ \tt 12, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 14, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you tell me what size those two pairs of jeans are, and what sizes are in stock?
