	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need an affordable shirt.\\ \tt System: I have affordable shirts. I have the dark pink and white striped one on the front row of the table, the grey brown one behind it to the left, and the grey brown one behind it to the right.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes the two grey brown ones and what sizes they are?\\ \tt System: Both of these grey brown shirts are medium. The one on the left is made by Modern Arts. The one on the right is made by Cats Are Great.\\ \tt User: I'll buy both of those then.\\ \tt System: Great. I'll put these two shirts in your cart for you.\\ \tt User: Do you have something else with a similar color and sizes as the one on the left and the dark pink one?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something else?\\ \tt User: I'd like to know the price and brand of the grey brown shirt on the left.\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt User: The grey brown shirt on the back left of the table.\\ \tt System: This one is by Modern Arts and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Can you show me black blouses with good ratings?\\ \tt System: I have the black blouse hanging up in the center cubby. It has a good rating.\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, that's all I have for black blouses with good ratings.\\ \tt User: Do you have any other options with similar sizing as that grey and white jacket in the same cubby, but for an affordable price?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 29, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 25, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 30, shirt, dark pink, white, S\\ \tt 51, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 52, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 54, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll buy the black blouse next to that jacket and the blue jacket beside it also.
