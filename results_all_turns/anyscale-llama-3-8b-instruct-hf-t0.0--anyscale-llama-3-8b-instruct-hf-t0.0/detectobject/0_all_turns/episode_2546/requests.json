Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Please show me some grey pants.\nSystem: Do you like either grey pair in the center of the right wall?\nUser: I'd actually prefer black.
