Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm looking for some tables.\nSystem: What do you think of the brown table in the very back just to the left of the wall?\nUser: I like its look and I can guess it has a nice rating. So what do you have that's similar to that, but in leather with a more affordable price?\nSystem: I didn't find anything matching that.\nUser: Well, how does that table compare?\nSystem: It has a 3.2 rating.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, Table, wooden, NA\n9, Lamp, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Alright. Thinking about it now, the lamp over to the far left looks nice.
