	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find a jacket to go with my general style?\\ \tt System: How about the blue jacket on the left, or the grey or blue and green jackets on the table to the right?\\ \tt User: Do you have something in the same color as the grey one, but with long sleeves and a good review?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but I don't have any jackets like that.\\ \tt User: Can you suggest anything else?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything else meeting your search terms.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt 0, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: How much for the blue one and the grey one?
