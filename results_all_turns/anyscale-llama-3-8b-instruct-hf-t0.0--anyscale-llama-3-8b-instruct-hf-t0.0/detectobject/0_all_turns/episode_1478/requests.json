Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Does this store carry any Ocean Wears blouses?\nSystem: They have a maroon, white, and blue one in the top row on the left wall. Would you like to get it?\nUser: Well, tell me the size first.\nSystem: For which item, specifically?\nUser: The multi-colored Ocean Wears one.\nSystem: That's an extra small.\nUser: Oh, that will work for me. I'll take it.\nSystem: Okay. I've placed it in your cart.\nUser: Can you tell me the customer review difference of the violet dress and short, purple dress hanging on the back freestanding rack?\nSystem: Sure. The violet one has the higher rating with a 4.8. The purple one has a rating of 3.6.\nUser: How about the ratings of the other purple dress and the dark pink one on the closer rack?\nSystem: I'm sorry. I'm not certain which items you mean. Would you mind clarifying?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
