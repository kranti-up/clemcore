	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to find a shirt made by Uptown Studio.\\ \tt System: I did find a couple of things by Uptown Studio. There's the blue and black shirt on the top row of the table, the third from the left, and the blue and black one on the bottom right side of the table.\\ \tt User: Which blouse would look best with my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: What about the second one on the right, hanging up against the windows? There's also the black one hanging on the rack just below that.\\ \tt User: I'd like to find something like the two blouses you just showed me.\\ \tt System: I only have these two items to show you.\\ \tt User: Please compare the available sizes for those blouses.\\ \tt System: The first one hanging up against the windows is available in XXL, S, XL, and L while the black one is available in XS, S, and XL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 78, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 53, shirt, brown, M\\ \tt 75, shirt, violet, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What shirt would match my wardrobe best?
