Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of these tops would you suggest I take a look at?\nSystem: I'd suggest the maroon Christmas sweater closest to you in the top row, the gray and white one below it, or the gray and white one in the middle of the bottom row.\nUser: Can you tell me about both of the gray and white tops?\nSystem: They have the same general info.
