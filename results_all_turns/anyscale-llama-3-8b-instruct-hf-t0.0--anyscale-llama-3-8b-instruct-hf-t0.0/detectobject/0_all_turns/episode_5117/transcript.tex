	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What kind of jeans you got in store?\\ \tt System: How about the light blue pairs in the back left and the bottom right side?\\ \tt User: Could you share the ratings and size on the light blue ones?\\ \tt System: Could you clarify which light blue jeans please?\\ \tt User: These light blue jeans to the right.\\ \tt System: The customer rating is 4.9 and the size is M.\\ \tt User: Are there any grey and white jackets that have great ratings?\\ \tt System: Take a look at the grey and white jacket above the blue jeans on the left and the grey and white jacket to the right above the blue jeans. These both have rather nice ratings.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 62, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 2, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in the same size as the one on the right but blue?
