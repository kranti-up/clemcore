Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I would like to find a hoodie today.\nSystem: We have a green one on the left side of the wall. Do you like it?\nUser: Do you have one that has text on it? And it can be in the expensive price range.\nSystem: I'm sorry, but that kind of item doesn't seem to be available.\nUser: Then how about a hoodie with a similar price but made by Global Voyager? And in a dark blue, I think.\nSystem: Unfortunately, there were no results for that search.\nUser: We can switch to looking at pants, then. What do you have with light stripes.\nSystem: We have a grey pair to the right of the mirror.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n14, hoodie, green, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Okay. I'll think about it. Do you have a long-sleeve jacket available that has a good rating?"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-846fdafb-8ab1-4ef6-8494-8692ba6b4822", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n14", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715913742, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 394}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:42:17.491977", "call_duration": "0:00:04.948766", "response": "ObjectID\n14", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
