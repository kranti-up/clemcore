	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any tee shirts?\\ \tt System: I have this green one on the upper right wall.\\ \tt User: How about some hoodies from Downtown Consignment?\\ \tt System: I have a green one on the left wall.\\ \tt User: Do you have some affordable coats from Coats and More?\\ \tt System: A search returned no results.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
