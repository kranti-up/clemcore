	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi. Tell me which dress would match my wardrobe.\\ \tt System: Take a look at the violet dress in the last rack, the other violet dress in the second to last rack, and the dark pink dress in the rack second from the front.\\ \tt User: Go head and add the violet dress in the last rack to my cart, along with the dark pink dress.\\ \tt System: Adding those now.\\ \tt User: Could you compare those two dresses?\\ \tt System: The dark pink dress is by The Vegan Baker, while the violet dress is by HairDo.\\ \tt User: What's the brand of the grey and brown T-shirts?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The grey T-shirt hanging in the back right on the wall, and the brown T-shirt hanging on the right in front of the window.\\ \tt System: Which T-shirt is by The Vegan Baker, while the brown one is by River Chateau.\\ \tt User: Could you find some thing similar in size to the gray and white blouse hanging in the back of the first rack?\\ \tt System: The red, white, and yellow blouse in the first track, the black and white blouse on the front left wall, and the maroon, white and blue blouse I just showed you are similar.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 35, dress, violet, XL\\ \tt 15, dress, dark pink, M\\ \tt 24, tshirt, grey, XL\\ \tt 0, tshirt, brown, L\\ \tt 11, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 5, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Well, I want a cheap blouse now.
