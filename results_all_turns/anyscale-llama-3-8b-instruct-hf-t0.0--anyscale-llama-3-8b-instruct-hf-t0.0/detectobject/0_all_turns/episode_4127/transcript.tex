	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me hoodies with a good customer review.\\ \tt System: There is blue hoodie which matches your criteria, as well as a green hoodie.\\ \tt User: Any that go with your wardrobe?\\ \tt System: There is a black jacket, a brown jacket, and a blue jacket, all of which match your current search criteria for matching your closet.\\ \tt User: What else do you have that you can show me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the light grey jacket in the right closet and the black jacket on the rack?\\ \tt User: Add the red, white, and yellow blouse to my cart. Also add the black dress.\\ \tt System: Okay, both of those items will be added to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 34, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 2, dress, black, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else can you recommend?
