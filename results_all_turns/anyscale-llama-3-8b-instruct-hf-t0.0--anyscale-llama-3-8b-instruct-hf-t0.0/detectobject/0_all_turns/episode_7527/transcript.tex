	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see any tees you have made by The Vegan Baker.\\ \tt System: How about the gray tee at the far left of the cabinet at the far right?  That's made by The Vegan Baker.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the brands and available sizes for that gray tee, and also the blue one closest to us on the garment rack?\\ \tt System: The gray one is by The Vegan Baker and available in XL, the blue one is from Glam Nails and comes in M and XL.\\ \tt User: I'd like to get something like those two shirts, but by Glam Nails.\\ \tt System: The blue one is made by Glam Nails.\\ \tt User: Tell me the price and size.\\ \tt System: For which item?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 29, tshirt, blue, XL\\ \tt 7, tshirt, grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: For the blue tee, please.
