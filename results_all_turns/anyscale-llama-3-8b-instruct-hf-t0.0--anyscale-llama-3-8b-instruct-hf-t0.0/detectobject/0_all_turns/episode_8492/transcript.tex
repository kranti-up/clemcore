	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What are the chances you could find me a Global Voyager couch with superior ratings?\\ \tt System: That grey sofa over there on the blue striped rug could be everything you've been dreaming of!\\ \tt User: Oh yeah I like that a lot. How does it score on customer satisfaction?\\ \tt System: Oops, I'm not sure which item you're asking about. Please be more specific.\\ \tt User: I mean the grey one on the blue rug you just pointed out to me.\\ \tt System: That sofa is rated a 2.7.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt 0, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt 2, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Uh, you call that a high rating? Forget the sofa, just tell me which brand makes those black end tables on either side of the red sofa.
