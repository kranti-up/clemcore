	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a nice top.\\ \tt System: How about the green, violet, and pink one in the left-hand cupboard, thegrey and white one in the right-hand cupboard, and the red, white, and yellow one on the floor hanger right in front of us?\\ \tt User: OK, can we look only at tops with a light spots pattern that are from Downtown Stylists?\\ \tt System: I  cannot find any tops with these characteristics, unfortunately.\\ \tt User: That's OK. I like the grey shoes on the right and the black and white ones. What other shoes do you have in these colors but in XXL?\\ \tt System: The grey pair on the right fits your description.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 19, shoes, black, white, S\\ \tt 16, shoes, grey, XL\\ \tt 20, shoes, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: OK, Any nice jackets with favorable reviews and in color grey?
