Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new shirt, what do you have that's well-rated in a vertically striped pattern?\nSystem: There's this white and grey shirt towards the far right corner of the bottom shelf of the display table.\nUser: I like the brand on that light red shirt that's in the back middle of the bottom shelf, do you have anything by them that's more expensive and in a size XXL?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything like that.
