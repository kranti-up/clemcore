Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there! I'm trying to express myself more and am antsy to add a new pink sweater to my collection. I would really appreciate some suggestions!\nSystem: Absolutely! We have a few you may like. How do you like the one hanging at the top or maybe the other pink one at the bottom?\nUser: Oh no, I think I actually already have something like that in my closet. What about jackets, do you have any I might like?\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have any pink jackets in an affordable price range.\nUser: Oh well, forget about the pink. I see a couple I would like to know more about. What is the price and brand of the black jacket at the bottom right? And also of the brown one at the top right?\nSystem: The black one costs .99 and is by 212 Local, while the brown one costs .99 and is by Coats & More.\nUser: Not bad, but now that I take another look, I don't see anything too special about them. Could we maybe try something knitted in a size S please?\nSystem: Unfortunately, we don't have anything matching those preferences.\nUser: Oh man, fine, I guess I can never really go wrong with black. Please add that black jacket to my cart! I'm sure I can style it with some bright colored accessories to bring it to life a bit more.\nSystem: Wonderful, I will add that item to your cart now.\nUser: I'm also in the search for some dresses. do you think you have anything sleeveless by Modern Arts?\nSystem: What do you think about two purple ones on the rack on the right?\nUser: Ok, maybe not that, let's try the brand Brain Puzzles instead? Sleeveless still please.\nSystem: Unfortunately, we don't have anything matching those preferences.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
