	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which jacket do you think goes best with my sense of style?\\ \tt System: How about this gray one or this brown one?\\ \tt User: Tell me more about them.\\ \tt System: The brown jacket comes in XS, S, M, and XXL.  The gray one comes in XS.\\ \tt User: I'll take the black coat and the gray and white blouse.\\ \tt System: I'll put those two in your cart.\\ \tt User: I'd like something in the same price range as the black coat.\\ \tt System: I have that one and a second black one.\\ \tt User: How are the ratings and available sizes of the brown jacket and the gray one?\\ \tt System: The brown one has a 3.2 rating and comes in XS, S, M, and XXL.  The gray one has a 3.6 rating and comes in XS.\\ \tt User: Do you have any coats?\\ \tt System: I have one black one.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 58, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 10, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 1, coat, black, L\\ \tt 13, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 2, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll take it.
