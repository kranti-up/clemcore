Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey!  I'm looking for a fresh pair of jeans, could you show me some stuff?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think of the light blue jeans in the third cubby from the right?\nUser: They're looking good for sure, but I need a coat too and I feel like I should look for that first.  Do you have any good ones?\nSystem: How do you like the black coat in the fourth cubby from the right, or the one in the farthest right cubby?  If you don't like black, I can also offer the grey coat hanging up on the rack to your right.  Any preferences?\nUser: Do you have anything else in black or grey?  I like the look of that first black one and the one on the rack.\nSystem: Sure, besides the garments I mentioned, I also have the black coat on the top row in the back corner of the room.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
