Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need help finding some shoes.\nSystem: I can recommend the black pair in the furthest bottom compartment on the left and another black pair on our left.\nUser: What other shoes are nice?\nSystem: I am not finding any other shoes.\nUser: I see.
