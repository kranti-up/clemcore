	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like you to find me some affordable wooden tables.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we have any in that price range at  the moment.  Is there anything else you would like to see?\\ \tt User: How about some affordable shelves?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, it doesn't look like I have that right now either.\\ \tt User: Could you tell me the price and rating of that brown chair at the back in the partitioned off area, and that white chair on the green rug at the back?\\ \tt System: The brown chair is  and has a 4.2, the white chair is  and has a 4.7.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, Chair, brown, NA\\ \tt 7, Chair, white, NA\\ \tt 8, Chair, brown, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually, I think I want that brown chair with wheels on the red rug.  I'll take that one.
