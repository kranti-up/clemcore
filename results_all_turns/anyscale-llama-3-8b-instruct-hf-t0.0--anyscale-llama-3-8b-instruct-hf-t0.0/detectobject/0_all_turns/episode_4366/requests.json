Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, could I take a look at your jackets in a size L, only ones with full length sleeves please.

We have two light blue and green ones that might interest you on the right and also a blue one below the blue shoeboxes.\nUser: That light blue and green one above the blue shoes is actually just what I'm looking for. Denim is always a classic look, definitely purchasing that.\nSystem: Great, I will add that to your cart now!\nUser: Do you also have anything similar to the jacket above the red shoes but by Brain Puzzles?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I can't find anything like that in that brand.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
