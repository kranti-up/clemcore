	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm in the market for a new sweater today.\\ \tt System: I've got the pink one in the second cabinet from the door, the black one in the fifth cabinet, and the pink one at the left side of the table.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything with a similar rating as the pink one in the cabinet?\\ \tt System: That pink one itself, the other pink one, and the black one you already saw.\\ \tt User: Can you recommend some tops maybe?\\ \tt System: On the closer round rack, I have the black one at the front left, the black and white one at the front right, and the red and yellow one in the cabinet closest to the door.\\ \tt User: Have you got any by Art Den in an XS?\\ \tt System: I don't believe I do.  Can I help you with anything else?\\ \tt User: Have you got anything with a good review that's like the violet shirt at the bottom left of the table, or the gray and brown one at the top right?\\ \tt System: Those two shirts both have a good rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 87, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 41, shirt, violet, L\\ \tt 29, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: How about some pants that have a good rating?
