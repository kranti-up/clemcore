Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Looking for a coat or two.\nSystem: I can help you with that! Take a look at these three and see what you think.\nUser: Not feeling it... maybe just a jacket from here then? Extra large please.\nSystem: This is the only jacket we have in XL at the moment.\nUser: Is that an XL? Also what other sizes are there?\nSystem: Sorry, which item are you referring to?\nUser: The jacket you just showed me obviously. Black, top middle shelf?\nSystem: Thank you for clarifying. The one on display is indeed an XL, but it also comes in S.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n9, jacket, black, XL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: You wouldn't happen to have anything with vertical stripes, would you?
