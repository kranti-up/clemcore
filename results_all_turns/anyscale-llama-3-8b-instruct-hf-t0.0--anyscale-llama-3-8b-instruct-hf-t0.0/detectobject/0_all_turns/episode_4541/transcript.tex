	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some dresses with a plain pattern.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the dark pink dress or the black dresses along the rack?\\ \tt User: What are the customer review scores for the dark pink dress and the black dress?\\ \tt System: Which items do you mean?\\ \tt User: I mean the dark pink dress on the left side of the rack and the black dress on teh left side of the rack.\\ \tt System: The dark pink dress has a score of 3.9 and the black dress has a score of 4.5.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
