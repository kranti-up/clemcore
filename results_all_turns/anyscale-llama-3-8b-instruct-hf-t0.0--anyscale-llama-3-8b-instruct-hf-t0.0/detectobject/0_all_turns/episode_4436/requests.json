Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

And I like the grey thing hanging beneath it. Can you tell me how those stack up please?\nSystem: The blouse on the bottom is grey and white and a size large, while the top above is maroon, white, and blue and is a size extra small.\nUser: The grey and white seems like the more sensible purchase.
