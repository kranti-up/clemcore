Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like find a jacket today!

On the right side of the store, there are two blue ones on the circular rack.\nUser: I'll go with the blue one on the left side and the blue one on the right rack that's sort of on the left side of that rack.\nSystem: Sure. I'll add both of those to your cart.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
