	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me look for a pink sweater?\\ \tt System: Have a look at the folded one on the right on the table or the one up top in the third cubby from the end.\\ \tt User: Can you compare them for me?\\ \tt System: Both are pink, the folded one is from Coats & More and the other is from Uptown Gallery.\\ \tt User: I see something else that I like. I want the grey jeans in the third cubby back and the black sweater above and to the left of those.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll add those both to your cart.\\ \tt User: Are there any nice black sweaters here?\\ \tt System: The one you're getting is the best option I see.\\ \tt User: Ok, how about a hoodie then?\\ \tt System: There's a nice green one on the left of the hanging rack in the front.\\ \tt User: Ok, maybe a dress instead. I need an XL.\\ \tt System: There's two options here, a brown one and a purple one hanging in the front.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 87, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 35, sweater, pink, L\\ \tt 62, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 61, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Are any of the dresses half sleeved and from Uptown Studio?
