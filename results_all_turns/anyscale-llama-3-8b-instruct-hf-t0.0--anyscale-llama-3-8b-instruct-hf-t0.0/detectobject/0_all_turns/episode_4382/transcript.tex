	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me a blouse from New Fashion. One with good customer reviews.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the white and black blouses on the closet?\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes for the white and black blouse?\\ \tt System: Which item are you talking about?\\ \tt User: I am talking about the white and black blouse on the left closet.\\ \tt System: It is available in S, M, XL, L, and XS.\\ \tt User: What else can you recommend?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey trousers along the second row?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 7, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add the brown hoodie to my cart, please.
