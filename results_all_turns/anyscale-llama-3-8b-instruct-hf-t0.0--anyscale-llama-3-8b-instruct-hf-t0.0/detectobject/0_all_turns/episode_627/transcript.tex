	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some sweaters with good ratings.\\ \tt System: I can help with that. I have the black one hanging in the leftmost cubby and the black sweater hanging on the front rack.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the prices and sizes of the white and red blouse in the second cubby and the black blouse in the same cubby?\\ \tt System: The white and red one is extra large and costs .99. The black one is small and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me what they are rated?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The same two blouses as before.\\ \tt System: Both of these blouses are rated 4.7.\\ \tt User: I'd like to look at options from Downtown Stylists with good ratings.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have any sweaters from Downtown Stylists with good ratings.\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy both of those blouses from before.\\ \tt System: Ok. I'll put the white and red and the black blouses to your cart for you.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 57, blouse, white, red, violet, XL\\ \tt 58, blouse, black, S\\ \tt 46, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 48, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you show me jeans?
