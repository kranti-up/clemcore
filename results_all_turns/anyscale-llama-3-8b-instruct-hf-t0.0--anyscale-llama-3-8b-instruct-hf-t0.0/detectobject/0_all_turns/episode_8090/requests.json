Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: It would be awesome if you could help me pick out a Brain Puzzles shirt.\nSystem: Does that grey one at the near end of the top row on the middle shelf speak to your fashion sense?
