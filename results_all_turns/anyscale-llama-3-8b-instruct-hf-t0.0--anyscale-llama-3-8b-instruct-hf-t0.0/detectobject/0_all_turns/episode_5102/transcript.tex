	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Alright, alright, alright!  I need a new hat, could you help me narrow it down if you've got a free second?\\ \tt System: Sure, how do you like the black and white hats closest to you on the left shelf?  If you do want a lighter color, the white hat on the right shelf would also be a good option.\\ \tt User: Hold it, hold everything.  Let's get a coat first.  What am I looking at for coats?\\ \tt System: Take a look at the black coat hanging on the rack just past the left hat display, or the black coat across from it on the other rack.  Are either of those of any interest?  If you're looking for a more professional look, the brown coat on the near left rack would be an excellent choice as well.\\ \tt User: None of them are really grabbing me, do you have anything else you can show me?\\ \tt System: Sure, there's also another black coat next to the first one I mentioned, and one in the far cubby on the left side of the room that you might be able to get a better look at.  I also have a grey coat in the near cubby on your right that you might be interested in.\\ \tt User: Let's go back to hats, none of these are really doing it for me.  Could you tell me the sizes for that black hat on the left, and that one just past the orange hat on my right?\\ \tt System: Sure, could you specify which hats you're referring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 65, hat, black, S\\ \tt 57, hat, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yeah, so, the black one on the left is the closest one, that's what I meant, and the black ones on the right is the one right behind the black and orange one.
