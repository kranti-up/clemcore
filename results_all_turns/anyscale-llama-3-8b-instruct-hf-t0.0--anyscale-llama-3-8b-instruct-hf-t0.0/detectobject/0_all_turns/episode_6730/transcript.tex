	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi. I'm trying to find a natural fiber area rug.\\ \tt System: I have a natural fiber rug I can show you. How about the white area rug located at the center of the room?\\ \tt User: What can you find me that similar in color and brand to the white lamp in the back on the left wall, but is affordable?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem we have anything like that. Is there something else I can search for?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt 7, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt 3, CouchChair, grey, NA\\ \tt 10, CouchChair, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yes. Would you compare ratings on the gray chair in the middle of the room to the white chair closest to me?
