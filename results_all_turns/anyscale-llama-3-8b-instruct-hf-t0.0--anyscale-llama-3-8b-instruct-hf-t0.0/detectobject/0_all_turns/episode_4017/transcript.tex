	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets with high ratings?\\ \tt System: I have these two on the right side of the floor stand and the one in the upper left.\\ \tt User: What sizes are available for the coat on  the left side of the floor stand, and who makes it?\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt User: The one on the left side of the floor stand.\\ \tt System: It comes from Pedal and Gears in XL.\\ \tt User: Have you got any black coats?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, this is the only one we have on the back of the floor stand.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 16, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can  you compare the second right one on the floor stand with the second one on the left for ratings and available sizes?
