Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm looking for dresses, what can you show me?\nSystem: Ok, I can help you with that!

Put both the black and olive dress and the brown and black dress in my cart!\nSystem: Of course, I'll do so right away!\nUser: Great! Are there any other dresses you think would go nicely with the rest of my closet?\nSystem: Yes, I have these other three as well. There's a black dress next to the black and olive one on the right, a maroon dress on the left, and a dark brown dress to the right of that.\nUser: Ok, those look promising.
