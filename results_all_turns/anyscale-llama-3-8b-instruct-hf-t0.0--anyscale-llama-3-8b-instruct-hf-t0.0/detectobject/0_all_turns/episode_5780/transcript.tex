	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a coat with good reviews.\\ \tt System: How is this black one in the top middle on the wall, or the other black one on the right side of the rack?\\ \tt User: How does the red, white and yellow blouse on the top right compare to the white red and violet one on the bottom of the left wall?\\ \tt System: The first one is rated 3.4, and the other one is rated 4.7.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 8, blouse, white, red, violet, XL\\ \tt 2, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 12, coat, black, L\\ \tt 1, dress, black, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar to those black coats, but made by Downtown Consignment?
