Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there! I'm trying to express myself more and am antsy to add a new pink sweater to my collection. I would really appreciate some suggestions!\nSystem: Absolutely! We have a few you may like. How do you like the one hanging at the top or maybe the other pink one at the bottom?\nUser: Oh no, I think I actually already have something like that in my closet. What about jackets, do you have any I might like?\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have any pink jackets in an affordable price range.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
