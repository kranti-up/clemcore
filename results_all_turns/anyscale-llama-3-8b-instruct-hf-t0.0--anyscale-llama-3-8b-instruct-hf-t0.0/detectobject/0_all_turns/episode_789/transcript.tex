	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could I see some dresses in a size XL?\\ \tt System: I have a black dress in the second to last compartment, another one just in front of it, and a third one in the third compartment.\\ \tt User: What about a brown leather jacket?\\ \tt System: How is this jacket in the third section?\\ \tt User: How does the first black dress in the second section compare to the black dress in the third section?\\ \tt System: The first dress is a size XL and costs .99, and the other one is a M and costs 94.99.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything that is grey in a size XXL?\\ \tt System: Sorry I don't have anything to show you. Would you like to see anything else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 88, dress, black, XL\\ \tt 86, dress, black, M\\ \tt 84, dress, black, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I would like to see some sweaters.
