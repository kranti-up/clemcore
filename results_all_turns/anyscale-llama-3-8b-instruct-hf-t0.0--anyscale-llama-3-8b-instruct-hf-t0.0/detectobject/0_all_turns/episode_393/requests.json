Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of these tops goes with just about everything?\nSystem: I've got the black one at the top of the wall, the black one in the second cabinet, and the gray and white diamond one in the third cabinet.\nUser: Have you got anything like that gray and white one color and brand-wise, but with a good rating?\nSystem: That top does have a good rating.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, blouse, white, grey, S\n5, blouse, black, XL\n48, jeans, dark blue, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh, cool.
