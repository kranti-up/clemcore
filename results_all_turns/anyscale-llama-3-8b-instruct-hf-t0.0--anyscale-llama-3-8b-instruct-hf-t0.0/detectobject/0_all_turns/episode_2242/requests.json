Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm trying to find a nice rug by Home Store. Do you have any?\nSystem: What are your thoughts on the white rug at the front by us? It's from Home Store.\nUser: Oh, I like that. Maybe. What shelves do you have with good ratings?\nSystem: The wooden colored shelf to the back against the wall or the darker brown to the left of that might work.\nUser: Maybe. Just to check, is there anything like the first rug you showed, but made of natural fibers from Modern Arts?\nSystem: Sorry, I didn't find anything else.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n4, AreaRug, white, NA\n2, Shelves, wooden, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok. Well, then I think I'll take both the rug and the light brown shelf against the wall."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-c77f18d2-3117-480f-a6fb-b0e07a0d11b6", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n4\n2", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715907642, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 7, "prompt_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 384}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 01:00:40.758735", "call_duration": "0:00:01.878051", "response": "ObjectID\n4\n2", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
