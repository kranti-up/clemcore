	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have large t-shirts?\\ \tt System: I have large t-shirts. Do you like this yellow one hanging on the left side of the back wall?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the ratings of the black coat on the left rack and the black coat hanging up above on the wall?\\ \tt System: The one on the rack is rated 3.0. The one on the wall is rated 4.5.\\ \tt User: Do you have jackets by North Lodge?\\ \tt System: I have the grey one on the left side cubby and the grey one on the left rack. Both of these are jackets by North Lodge.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the size of the black coat on the left rack?\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 123, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 11, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The black coat on the rack on the left side of the room.
