Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello there! Could you show me some of your finest sofa chairs? I'm hosting the next book club meeting and would like to impress!\nSystem: Of course! For sofa chairs, we have the grey one in the middle there across from the red sofa, another grey one closer to the front to the right and a white one in front of that to the left. Do any of those suit your preferences?\nUser: I'm not sure yet, it would be nice if I could test them out. Guess I have to rely on ratings though, what are ratings of the grey one in the back and the grey one to the right?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which one did you want to know that for?\nUser: For the one across from the red sofa over there and the grey one towards the right closer to us.\nSystem: Yes, the one in the back has a customer rating of 4.8, while the one closer to right has a rating of 4.8.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n3, CouchChair, grey, NA\n9, CouchChair, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Gotcha, do you have something like the rightmost one but with better ratings? It's just this book meeting has to be absolutely perfect."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-2774a320-d09d-4bb6-bcba-c6c4c05b3863", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n9", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715914800, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5, "prompt_tokens": 464, "total_tokens": 469}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:59:58.757349", "call_duration": "0:00:01.578491", "response": "ObjectID\n9", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
