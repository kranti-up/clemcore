	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some dress recs please.\\ \tt System: There are several beautiful dresses on this rack smack dab in front! Do you feel drawn to either of the black dresses on the right-hand side or the black and olive one hanging on the back side?\\ \tt User: That dark one is nice yeah. Could I hear the sizes it's made in?\\ \tt System: Sorry, it isn't clear to me which dress you're talking about. Could you try describing it again?\\ \tt User: It's the black and olive-colored one hanging at the back of this first rack.\\ \tt System: That dress comes in small and large.\\ \tt User: Perfect. Please put that dress in my cart.\\ \tt System: Will do! The dress will be in your cart shortly.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, dress, black, olive, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Now let's see what you've got by Downtown Consignment.
