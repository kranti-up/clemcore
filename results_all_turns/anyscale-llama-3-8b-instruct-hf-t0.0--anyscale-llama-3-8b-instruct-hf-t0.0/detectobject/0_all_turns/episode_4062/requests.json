Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there, how's it going?  Could you give me some recommendations for a cozy sweater?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the pink sweater on the top row to your right?

Add those both to my cart, please.\nSystem: Certainly, I've added both to your cart.\nUser: Tell me, how do the two black sweaters you showed me compare?\nSystem: The one on the table has a plain pattern and a customer rating of 3.1, and the one hanging up has a knit pattern and a customer rating of 3.1.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
