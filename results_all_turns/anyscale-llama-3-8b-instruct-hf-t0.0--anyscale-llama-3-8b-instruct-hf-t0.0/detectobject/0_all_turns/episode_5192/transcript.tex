	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see what you've got in brown pants, please.\\ \tt System: In the second cabinet from the left, I've got that brown pair of pants.\\ \tt User: Those are exactly what I need!  Can you move them to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure thing.  Adding the pants now.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like that black blazer between the light gray and blue ones on the garment rack, but in the expensive range?\\ \tt System: I've got that blazer itself, the light gray one to the the left of it, and the other black blazer two over from the first black one.\\ \tt User: Can I get the size and brand of the black one?\\ \tt System: Which black one do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 45, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 63, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I mean the one next to the light gray one.
