Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need to look at blouses today.\nSystem: Do you like the black one on the right wall, the black one on the back side of the front rack, or the black and white one on the very back wall?

I have the black one hanging on the back of the front rack and the black one on the front of the rack.\nUser: Can you compare the black jacket on the right wall with the light grey jacket on the front rack?\nSystem: The one on the wall is long sleeved and small. The one on the rack is full sleeved and extra large.\nUser: Do you have something in medium maybe?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I don't have any short sleeve dresses in medium.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
