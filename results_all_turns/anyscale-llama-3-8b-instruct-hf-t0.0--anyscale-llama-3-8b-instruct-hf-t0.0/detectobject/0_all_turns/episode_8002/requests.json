Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are there some nice blouses here in your opinion?\nSystem: See how you feel about that funky red, white, and yellow knit option, the black studded tank, and the green, violet, and pink blouse.\nUser: Actually I'm feeling more drawn to that black blouse with the zigzags. Got anything else for the same price?\nSystem: If you like that black blouse, you might love the other black blouse near it and the dark grey one a cubby to the right.\nUser: I'd like to see more options with good reviews.\nSystem: I'm sorry, but I can't find any more blouses with good reviews for that price.\nUser: In that case, I'll go ahead and grab the dark grey tank and that bright blue jacket hanging on the far right. Mind throwing those in my cart for me?\nSystem: Not at all! That shirt and that jacket will be in your cart momentarily.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
