Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there! Going hunting this weekend and want to find a camouflage hat today. Could you help me find one please?\nSystem: Of course! How do you like the one on the table?\nUser: I actually don't think the pattern looks that great on that one. Let's skip it, do you have cheap jeans by any chance? I'll be in the woods and need something I wouldn't feel guilty about getting dirty.\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have any jeans in that price range.\nUser: Ok, no problem, I'll just take that blue jacket above the camo pants and the camo pants under them. Guess it'll be easy for my buddies to see me but will only be camouflaged from the waist down. What they would expect of me and my style anyway!\nSystem: Great, I will add those to your cart now.\nUser: Can you actually tell me the price of that though?\nSystem: I'm not sure which one you mean.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
