Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What do you have in rugs from Art Den?\nSystem: The red oriental rug in the back is from Art Den.\nUser: What's the rug over there made of?\nSystem: I'm sorry, could you be more specific which rug you're asking about?\nUser: Oh, I mean the red rug.  My bad.\nSystem: Not a problem.  That rug is made of natural fibers.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, AreaRug, red, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Cool.
