Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me some good jeans?\nSystem: I'd be happy to! We have some nice jeans  in the lower row in the cupboards along the wall facing us.

I will take the light-blue pair and the first pair from the left in the second cupboard,\nSystem: Sure! I am adding them to your basket as we speak.\nUser: I am also interested in something like the second blue pair in the cupboard on the left, but I want it to have heavy stripes.\nSystem: Unfortunately, we have no jeans in that pattern todaty.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
