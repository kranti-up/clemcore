Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I heard you might have some Modern Arts shelves here?\nSystem: Those wooden ones in the back on the dark multicolored rug are made by that brand!\nUser: Hm, that's definitely the color and brand I want, but I'm gonna need higher customer ratings.\nSystem: I'm sorry, but I don't have any similar items with higher ratings to offer you today.\nUser: That's a shame.
