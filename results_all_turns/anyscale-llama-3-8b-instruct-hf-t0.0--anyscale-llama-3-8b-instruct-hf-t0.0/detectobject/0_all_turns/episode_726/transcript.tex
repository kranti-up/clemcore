	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Any good long sleeve coats with good ratings?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the light gray coat on the bar against the left wall in the very back?\\ \tt User: Hm, what about knit coats specifically?\\ \tt System: I didn't find any matches, sorry.\\ \tt User: Ok, how about some affordably priced long sleeve sweaters?\\ \tt System: I didn't receive any hits.\\ \tt User: Ugh. How about those two pair of blue jeans? Do you have anything else that's like them to show?\\ \tt System: Those are the only ones close enough to show, but I'd be happy to tell you more about them.\\ \tt User: Do you have any to show with good ratings?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I didn't receive any hits.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 48, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 46, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok... how about some shoes?
