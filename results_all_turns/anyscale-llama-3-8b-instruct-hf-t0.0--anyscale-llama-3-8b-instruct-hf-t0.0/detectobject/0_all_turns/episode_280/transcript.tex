	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a good hoodie, do you have any?\\ \tt System: How about the green hoodie to the right?\\ \tt User: Oh, I like it... anything with the same size and color but in denim?\\ \tt System: Not for hoodies, no. I'm sorry.\\ \tt User: Ah, what about dark green?\\ \tt System: I didn't find any hits, anything else I can do?\\ \tt User: Well, any cheap pants to show?\\ \tt System: I didn't find anything cheaply priced, sorry.\\ \tt User: Well, I can tell that I like the look of those joggers dead center, and the grey jeans to the right of them. I'll take em.\\ \tt System: You got it, I'll add those now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 58, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 61, joggers, dark green, XL\\ \tt 62, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 5, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have any small, plain jackets to recommend?
