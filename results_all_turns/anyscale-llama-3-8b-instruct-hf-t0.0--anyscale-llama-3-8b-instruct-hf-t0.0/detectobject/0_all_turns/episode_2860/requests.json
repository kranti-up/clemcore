Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm crossing my fingers you'll tell me you see a blue Global Voyager hoodie.\nSystem: That blue one in the back on the right end of those shelves on the left are made by that brand!\nUser: Can I see some more choices with high ratings please?\nSystem: I apologize, but it looks like there are no highly rated blue hoodies by Global Voyager here.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n85, hat, dirty green, XXL\n87, shirt, yellow, S\n52, jacket, grey, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh rats.
