	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you recommend a coat for me?\\ \tt System: There is a black coat in the front on the right, a grey option in the section just behind it, and a light grey option on the left in the second to last section.\\ \tt User: I'll take that grey option, as well as the black option you showed me.\\ \tt System: Perfect, I will update your cart.\\ \tt User: What are the reviews on those coats?\\ \tt System: Which coats are you talking about?\\ \tt User: The grey coat and the black coat in my cart.\\ \tt System: The grey one is rated 4.6, and the black 4.5.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
