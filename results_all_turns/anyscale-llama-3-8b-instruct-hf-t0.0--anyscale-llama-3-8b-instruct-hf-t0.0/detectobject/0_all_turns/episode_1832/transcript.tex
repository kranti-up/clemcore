	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new vest, something cheap but still highly rated.\\ \tt System: Ok, I have this white vest on the bottom of the wall rack in the center.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with the same sort of pattern and sizing options as that, but by The Vegan Baker?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I do not.\\ \tt User: Alright, I'll take that green sweater down below it then.\\ \tt System: Sure thing, I'll put that in your cart now!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, vest, white, S\\ \tt 11, sweater, green, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Is there anything else you can recommend?
