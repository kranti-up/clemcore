Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I am interested in sweatshirts that your other customers have found good quality.\nSystem: We have some quality sweaters folded on the tiered rack on the left.

The maroon one is rated 3.4.\nUser: What other sweaters are good?\nSystem: Let's take a look at some more folded sweaters: the brown one in the middle of the middle tier, the green one at the far end of the back row on the bottom tier, and the dark grey one at the end of the front row on the bottom tier.
