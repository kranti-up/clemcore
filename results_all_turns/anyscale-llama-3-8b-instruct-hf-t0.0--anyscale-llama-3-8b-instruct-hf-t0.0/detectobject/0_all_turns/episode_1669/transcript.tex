	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello there. Are there any sweaters around?\\ \tt System: I found a red and white sweater under the right window, a black one hanging in the upper left, and a pink one on the black wall, bottom left.\\ \tt User: What're the available sizes and ratings of the pink sweater and red and white sweater?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The pink one and red and white one.\\ \tt System: The pink one is rated 3.8 and comes in S, M, and L, while the red and white one is rated 3.6 and comes in XS through XL.\\ \tt User: I want a long-sleeved sweater.\\ \tt System: Besides the pink sweater, there's a red sweater hanging in the front rack, as well as a red and white one on the right wall under the window.\\ \tt User: Compare the price and size of the pink sweater and red and white sweater.\\ \tt System: The red and white one is a L and costs .99, while the pink one is a S and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Add the black dress in back right corner of the room to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, adding that now.\\ \tt User: Also, do you see any nice sweaters?\\ \tt System: Tell me what you think of the yellow and black sweater on the bottom tier of the table, the maroon one on the top right, and the red one on the top left.\\ \tt User: Okay, I'll add the grey coat hanging under the window to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, I'll add that now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 32, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 4, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 30, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 28, dress, black, M\\ \tt 77, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 78, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I want something similar in price to the maroon, white, and blue blouse and black blouse, except by The Vegan Baker.
