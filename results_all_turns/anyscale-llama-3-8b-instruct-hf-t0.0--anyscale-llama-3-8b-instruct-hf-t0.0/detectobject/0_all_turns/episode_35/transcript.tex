	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new pair of jeans.\\ \tt System: Do you like the grey pair in the second cubby or the dark blue pair next to it? They are both jeans.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see options with a similar pricing and sizing as those two pairs but in small and denim.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy the grey pair I think.\\ \tt System: Ok. I'll put that pair in your cart for you.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes it and how much it costs?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The grey pair of jeans.\\ \tt System: This pair is made by Cats Are Great and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Can you suggest pants to match my clothes?\\ \tt System: I have the grey pair in the very far right cubby.\\ \tt User: How about some affordable hoodies?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different.\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy another pair of those grey jeans.\\ \tt System: Ok. I'll put that additional pair in your cart for you.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see other options like it.\\ \tt System: That grey pair, the blue pair next to it, and the grey pair all the way to the left are what I have like that.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 62, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 63, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?
