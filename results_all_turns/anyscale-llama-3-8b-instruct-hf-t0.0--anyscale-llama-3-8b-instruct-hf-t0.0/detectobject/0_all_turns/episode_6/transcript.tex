	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any plain jeans?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey pair on the left?\\ \tt User: Sorry, I misspoke. Can you show me dresses instead?\\ \tt System: There's a maroon one on the wall on the right, and a brown one and a grey one on the rack.\\ \tt User: Does the grey have good reviews?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt User: The grey one on the hanging rack.\\ \tt System: That dress has a high rating at 4.3.\\ \tt User: I was kind of looking for something more floral.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry. I don't have any floral dresses right now.\\ \tt User: How about something with a pattern that will make me look taller? A blouse from New Fashion maybe?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry. I don't have any blouses like that from New Fashion.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 36, dress, grey, XXL\\ \tt 26, shirt, brown, XL\\ \tt 23, dress, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have any good shirts at all?
