Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

The one on the right is a size S and is reviewed at 3.8.\nUser: Ok, what a shame, they're too small. Can we look at trousers instead? Maybe like the grey one under the black coat or the other grey one to the left of those? Definitely has to be an XS.\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have anything similar to those.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
