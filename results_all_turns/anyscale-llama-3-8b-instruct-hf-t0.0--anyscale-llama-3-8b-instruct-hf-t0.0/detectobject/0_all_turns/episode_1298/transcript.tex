	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have nice shirts for me?\\ \tt System: I have the blue and black one on the top row of the table, the grey one underneath it, and the grey and brown one next to it for you.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see something with similar sizes as the grey and grey and brown one but in dark violet and extra large.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes that grey and black sweater?\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt User: The one on the table also.\\ \tt System: This one is made by Downtown Consignment.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 73, shirt, grey, XS\\ \tt 61, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 60, sweater, grey, black, XL\\ \tt 69, shirt, blue, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else do you have for me?
