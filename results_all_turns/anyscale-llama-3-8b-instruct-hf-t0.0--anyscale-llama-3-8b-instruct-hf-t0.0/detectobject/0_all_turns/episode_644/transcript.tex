	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have blouses for me?\\ \tt System: I have blouses. I have the black one on the top of the wall to the left, the black one in the second cubby, and the white and grey one in the next cubby over.\\ \tt User: Do you have something else with a similar price as that black one to the left but available in XXL?\\ \tt System: This black blouse to the left is what I have for you.\\ \tt User: Can you compare it with the white and grey one from the center cubby?\\ \tt System: The black one is XXL and the white and grey one is S.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the size of the white and grey blouse from the center cube?\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt User: The white and grey blouse in the second cubby from the right.\\ \tt System: This one is S.\\ \tt User: I'll buy it.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll put it in your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, XXL\\ \tt 6, blouse, white, grey, S\\ \tt 51, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 52, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have blue jeans for me?
