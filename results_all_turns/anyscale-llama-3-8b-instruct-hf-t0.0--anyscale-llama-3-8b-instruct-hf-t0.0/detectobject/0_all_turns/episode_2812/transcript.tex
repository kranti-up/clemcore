	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any affordable dresses to show me?\\ \tt System: Do you like the black one on the back wall or the brown one on the front rack? They are both affordably priced.\\ \tt User: Do you have any other options like the black one on the back wall?\\ \tt System: I have the black dress on the front rack, the olive dress behind it, and the purple dress in the very front.\\ \tt User: Can you show me extra extra large plain coats?\\ \tt System: I have the grey one on the back wall. It is an extra extra large plain coat.\\ \tt User: I'll take that olive dress.\\ \tt System: Ok, I will put it in your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, dress, black, M\\ \tt 7, dress, olive, L\\ \tt 14, dress, brown, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll take the brown and black dress also.
