Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

The pink has a 3.8 rating and is available in S, M, and L.\nUser: What about something with similar ratings and set of available sizes as the green sweater and the yellow and black on the left, but in pink with a plain pattern?\nSystem: I don't have any sweaters like that.\nUser: Any other suggestions at all?\nSystem: Unfortunately I have none.
