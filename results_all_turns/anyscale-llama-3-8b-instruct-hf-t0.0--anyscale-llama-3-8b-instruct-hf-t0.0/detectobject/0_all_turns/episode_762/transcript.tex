	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any plain pattern coats?\\ \tt System: There are several, yes. Take a look at the light grey coat and the two brown coats.\\ \tt User: Add the brown coat on the front rack to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, it will be added.\\ \tt User: Now show me something like the brown dress and the purple dress on the middle rack.\\ \tt System: There are several similar items, including a beige dress, a purple dress, and a black dress.\\ \tt User: What is the customer review score and price for the light grey coat and the brown coat?\\ \tt System: Which do you mean?\\ \tt User: I mean the light grey coat on the left wall and the brown coat on the rack.\\ \tt System: The light grey coat has a score of 3.8 and is 179.99. The other has a score of 4.1 and is 59.99.\\ \tt User: Get me the size and customer review rating for the purple dress and the beige dress.\\ \tt System: Which items do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 50, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 34, dress, brown, M\\ \tt 31, dress, purple, XL\\ \tt 23, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 47, dress, purple, L\\ \tt 43, dress, beige, M\\ \tt 76, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 80, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am referring to the purple and beige dresses which  are on the rack in the middle of the room.
