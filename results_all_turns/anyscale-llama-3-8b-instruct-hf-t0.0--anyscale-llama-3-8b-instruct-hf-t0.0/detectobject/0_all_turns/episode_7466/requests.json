Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

I'd be grateful if you'd add that black coat and that light grey one to my cart for me.\nSystem: Will do! Those coats will be added right away.\nUser: Now do you possibly have other options with the same available sizes and colors by the brand Ocean Wears?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I cannot find any similar coats by that brand.
