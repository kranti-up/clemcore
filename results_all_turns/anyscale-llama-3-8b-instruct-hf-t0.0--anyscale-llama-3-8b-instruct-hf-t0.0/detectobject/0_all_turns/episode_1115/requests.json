Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, do you have any blouses to recommend for me?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think of the grey and white blouse at the front right?\nUser: It's ok.  What about a grey jacket?\nSystem: I have one, it's hanging up high beside the pink sweater.\nUser: Are there any more?\nSystem: That's all for grey jackets.  Is there something else that you're interested in?\nUser: Do you have anything similar to the yellow and black sweater in terms of brand and pattern, but in size S and having good reviews.\nSystem: Well, there isn't anything else, but that sweater does have good reviews and comes in size S.\nUser: Oh really?
