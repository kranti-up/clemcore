	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to find a nice pair of grey bottoms if possible.\\ \tt System: How does this first grey pair on the left look to you?\\ \tt User: Ooh that brown jacket above it is so poppin! Let's get that in my cart, and I also want that grey and white blouse at the end of that same cubby.\\ \tt System: I will get those pieces in your cart immediately.\\ \tt User: Now as for those pants. What sizes do those come in? And what about the ones next to them? Oh and I need to know the brands.\\ \tt System: It isn't clear to me which pants you're talking about. Could you be more specific please?\\ \tt User: I mean those grey pants and the camo green ones right next to them.\\ \tt System: The grey pants are only available in extra small and are made by Coats & More. The camo pants are only available in extra large and are made by North Lodge.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 1, blouse, grey, white, XL\\ \tt 7, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 6, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok wait what did you say the available sizes were?
