Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs.

It would be real cool if you could cart those for me.\nSystem: With pleasure. Those brown pants will be added to your cart.\nUser: I'd also be interested in seeing some shirts with stripes that run length-wise, if you've got any good ones.\nSystem: What do you think of that brown and white striped shirt on the rack in the middle of the floor?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
