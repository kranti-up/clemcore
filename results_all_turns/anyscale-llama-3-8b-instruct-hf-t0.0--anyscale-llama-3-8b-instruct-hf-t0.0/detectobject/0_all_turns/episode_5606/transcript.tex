	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have a long sleeved extra small coats?\\ \tt System: I have this black one in the buggy on the top right and the grey one on the back side of the center rack.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the ratings and sizes of the brown and green pairs of pants in the bottom right cubbies?\\ \tt System: The brown one is rated 3.6 and available in XS. The green one is rated 3.9 and available in XL.\\ \tt User: Let's put the brown coat on the top left in my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok. I'll put that coat in your cart right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 11, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt 0, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 29, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I would like plain joggers with a stripe on the side.
