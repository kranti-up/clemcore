	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a nice jacket?\\ \tt System: Yes, I have the brown jacket in the bottom row on the wall, the black one in the top row there, and the grey and white one in the second compartment from the left.\\ \tt User: Thanks! Could you tell me who makes the green, violet, and pink top on the floor rack closer to us and the black top, also on that rack?\\ \tt System: Of course! The green, violet, and pink blouse is from Cats Are Great, and the black one is from Art News Today.\\ \tt User: Thanks! I will buy one of each, please.\\ \tt System: Sure! I am putting them into your cart now.\\ \tt User: Thanks! I also want a hooded sweater.\\ \tt System: I have the green one on the floor rack closer to us. Do you like it?\\ \tt User: OK, are there any nice tops here?\\ \tt System: Yes, I have green, violet, and pink one you just saw, the black and white one on the same floor hanger, and the white, red, and violet one in the second compartment from the left.\\ \tt User: OK. Can you also help me find a sweater?\\ \tt System: How do you like the pink one on the right?\\ \tt User: Ok, let's go back to blouses. What can you show me similar to the green, violet, and pink one that was on the floor hanger close to us in that other room and to the black one on the same hanger, but with favorable customer ratings?\\ \tt System: The black and white top in the second compartment on the right  is similar,  so is the red, white, and yellow one in the next compartment, and the grey and white one in the compartment by the entrance.\\ \tt User: Nice! OK, I will take the blue jeans on the right and the black dress in the compartment above them.\\ \tt System: Got it! I am adding these items to your cart now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 71, blouse, green, violet, pink, XXL\\ \tt 63, blouse, black, S\\ \tt 92, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 88, dress, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you also have a nice high-end dress to show me, with designs?
