	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am interested in a plain pattern dress.\\ \tt System: What do you think of this purple one on the bottom shelf, the maroon one to the right, and the grey one to the right of that. They are all plain patterned dresses.\\ \tt User: Size of that item?\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt User: I meant the grey dress.\\ \tt System: It's available in size XXL.\\ \tt User: And what's the difference in price and brand of the purple dress and the maroon dress?\\ \tt System: The purple one is from Uptown Gallery, priced at 224.99, while the maroon one is from Nature Photographers, and is priced at 184.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, dress, grey, XXL\\ \tt 3, dress, purple, XL\\ \tt 4, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar to the purple dress and the maroon dress in terms of sleeve length and customer review.
