	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some tshirts with half sleeves and good customer reviews.\\ \tt System: What do you think about the blue tshirt on the center rack? It has half sleeves and good customer reviews.\\ \tt User: Add it to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure, I will go ahead and add it to your cart.\\ \tt User: Which hats do you recommend?\\ \tt System: How do you feel about the grey hat in the back, the gray in the middle, and the black hat in the front?\\ \tt User: What is the size?\\ \tt System: Can you clarify which hats you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, tshirt, blue, M\\ \tt 9, hat, grey, S\\ \tt 13, hat, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I meant the one in the middle and the one in the front.
