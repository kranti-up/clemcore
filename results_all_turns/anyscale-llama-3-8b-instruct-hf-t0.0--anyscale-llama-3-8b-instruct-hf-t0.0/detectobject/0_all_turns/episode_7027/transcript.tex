	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see some jackets please.\\ \tt System: I've got the blue jacket hanging in the top row, as well as the light gray one hanging in the bottom row.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything with a similar sleeve length as the light gray one in the top row at the left?\\ \tt System: That coat is the only one with that sleeve length.\\ \tt User: Can I get the rating of the blue jacket and the light gray one under it?\\ \tt System: The gray one has a 2.6, the blue one has a 2.8.\\ \tt User: Could you repeat that one's rating?\\ \tt System: For which jacket?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 14, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I mean for the gray one please.
