Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new shirt, what do you have available?\nSystem: Take a look at these. I have a grey shirt second from the far right corner on the bottom shelf of the table, a blue and white shirt at the far end of the top shelf, and a dark pink and white shirt on the front corner of the middle shelf.\nUser: Are there any others you could recommend?\nSystem: Yes, I have three more you might like. There's a white and blue shirt in the center of the top shelf, a white and blue shirt on the far right corner of the bottom shelf, and another dark pink and white shirt second from the front on the left of the bottom shelf.\nUser: I'll pass for now.
