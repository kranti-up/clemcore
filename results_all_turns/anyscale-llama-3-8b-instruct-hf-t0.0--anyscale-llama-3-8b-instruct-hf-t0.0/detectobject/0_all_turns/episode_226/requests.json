Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What decent trousers do you see, if any?\nSystem: Those grey ones on the far right would be a great buy!\nUser: That multicolored purplish short-sleeved top is so charming! Would you be a doll and put it in my cart for me?\nSystem: With pleasure! That top will be in your cart soon.\nUser: Oh I got a little carried away and forgot to ask for the size range and what brand makes it.\nSystem: Which item would you like to know those details on?\nUser: The multicolored short-sleeved top with the kind of floral-looking design.\nSystem: Cats Are Great is the brand that makes that top.

And I'm gonna need to hear the sizes again. My brain can only process so much information at once.\nSystem: The multicolored short-sleeved blouse is available in small, large, and extra extra large, while the black and white tank is available in everything from extra small to extra large. These shirts actually cost the exact same price of .99.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
