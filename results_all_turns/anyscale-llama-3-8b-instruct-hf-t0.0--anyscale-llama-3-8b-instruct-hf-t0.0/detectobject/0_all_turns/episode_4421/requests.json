Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need some shoes, can you show me a good pair?\nSystem: Of course! I have a black pair and a grey pair on the right-hand side of the room, and I also have a black and white pair on the right end of the center display.\nUser: Are there any others you could show me?\nSystem: What about the grey pair in the middle or the other black and white pair on the left end of the center display?\nUser: I'll have to think about it. Could you also tell me the price and overall rating on the black coat towards the left and the light grey one in the center?\nSystem: Sure, both coats cost .99, but the black one has a lower rating at 3.0 compared to the 3.8 rating on the light grey coat.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
