	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some nice sweaters.\\ \tt System: I have two pink ones.\\ \tt User: I'd like something from the same brand in the same price range.\\ \tt System: I only have those two pink ones I showed you.\\ \tt User: Can you narrow down my search to expensive items?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything matching that criteria.\\ \tt User: I'll take those two maroon dresses.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll put them in your cart.\\ \tt User: I'd also like to browse jackets.\\ \tt System: I have these three brown ones.\\ \tt User: Can you show me sweaters from Brain Puzzles?\\ \tt System: I have a dark yellow one from that brand.\\ \tt User: I'd like something similar to the red and black suit in terms of sleeve length and brand, but blue and green and with good ratings.\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything like that.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
