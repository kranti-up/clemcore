	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, do you have any jackets for me to check out?\\ \tt System: Sure, hanging straight ahead of you below the blue and white shoe boxes is a lovely light grey jacket.  At the far right end of the same shelving unit is a blue jacket.   Finally, there's another blue one hanging on the round rack over at the back right.\\ \tt User: Can you get me the ratings for the blue ones?\\ \tt System: Definitely, the one over on the circle rack is rated 4.8, while the one on the shelving unit is rated just 2.8.\\ \tt User: Ok.  I actually love this white hat on the table at the far right, can I take it?   And also those black shoes below the light grey coat.\\ \tt System: Of course, I've put those items in your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 12, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 8, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 15, hat, white, M\\ \tt 22, shoes, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you hav any hats with good reviews?
