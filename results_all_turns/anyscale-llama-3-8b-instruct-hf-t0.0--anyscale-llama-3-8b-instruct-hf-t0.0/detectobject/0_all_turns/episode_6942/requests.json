Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi! I'm chair shopping today.\nSystem: Cool! Let's start with that white chair in the back. What are your thoughts?\nUser: I think I might prefer this beige one up front or maybe that grey one to the left. Can you tell me what they're made with?\nSystem: Both of those pieces are made with leather.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n10, CouchChair, white, NA\n9, CouchChair, grey, NA\n3, CouchChair, grey, NA\n0, Lamp, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh wait I found it! That grey chair on the grey rug over there is just divine. If you would be so good as to add it to my cart I'd be mighty thankful! And throw that white lamp on the ground by the green lamp in while you're at it."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-453366f3-cbae-44ea-92b0-215ec2c90df6", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n3\n0", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715914843, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 7, "prompt_tokens": 378, "total_tokens": 385}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 03:00:42.372322", "call_duration": "0:00:01.129825", "response": "ObjectID\n3\n0", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
