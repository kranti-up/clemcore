Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm looking for a nice carpet.\nSystem: For rugs, I would recommend the red one to the left in the back, and the white rug in the front.\nUser: Maybe.

The one to the right costs  but has a 4.4.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
