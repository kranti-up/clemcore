Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

What's the brand and rating on that grey and brown shirt? And on the light grey shirt at the far end as well?\nSystem: Both shirts are by Modern Arts. The light grey shirt has a 3.7 rating, but the grey and brown shirt has only a 2.8 rating.\nUser: Alright, do you have anything else with a similar brand and price tag to that light grey one?\nSystem: I'm afraid the light grey shirt and the grey and brown shirt are the only ones currently available that fit your description.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
