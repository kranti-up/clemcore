Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are there any jeans around here that you would approve of?\nSystem: Those grey jeans in the very back to the left and the dark blue jeans on the right would both be wise purchases.\nUser: Oh wait can we talk hats first? I can't stop looking at the dark green one next to the black and orange cap on the left, and I'm also really digging that first camo option on the right. Can I have you get me the sizes of those? And which is more budget-friendly?\nSystem: The camo hat is an extra small and costs less, at .99. The green hat on the left is an extra extra large priced at .99.\nUser: That's not too bad. I'll take both! Chuck them in the cart if you don't mind.\nSystem: Great! I'll put those hats in your cart for you straight away.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n73, hat, green, XS\n71, hat, dirty green, XXL\n72, hat, green, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Actually, hold on. I wanna know if there's anything in the same size and pattern as that camo one but with higher ratings."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-2d593e51-fecb-47ca-931c-1222a7bf4384", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n72", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715911693, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5, "prompt_tokens": 447, "total_tokens": 452}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:08:08.345456", "call_duration": "0:00:04.880241", "response": "ObjectID\n72", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
