	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see some extra small pants.\\ \tt System: Do you like either of the pairs of brown pants in the right cubbies or the grey pair in the cubby to the left? They are all extra small pants.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the brands and available sizes of the grey pants to the left and the brown to the far right?\\ \tt System: The brown ones are available in River Chateau and available in extra small. The grey ones are by The Vegan Baker and are available in extra small and small.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see options like those two pairs but in large.\\ \tt System: I have the blue pair of pants in the cubby.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 21, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?
