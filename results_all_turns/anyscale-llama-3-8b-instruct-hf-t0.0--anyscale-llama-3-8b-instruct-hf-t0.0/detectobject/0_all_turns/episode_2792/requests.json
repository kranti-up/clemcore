Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Would you be able to recommend a good shirt to me?\nSystem: Are you interested in this white and blue shirt to the right, or perhaps the bright pink item next to it?

Anything else?\nSystem: I'm sorry we have no other shirts in store.\nUser: I'll take that black blouse behind the blue shirt and the grey and white blouse on the left.\nSystem: Great.
