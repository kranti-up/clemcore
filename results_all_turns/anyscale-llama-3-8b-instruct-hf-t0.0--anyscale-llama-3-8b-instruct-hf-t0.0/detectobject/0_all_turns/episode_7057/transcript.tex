	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Jackets.\\ \tt System: How about the grey and white one hanging up on the wall on the left, the grey and white one hanging on the bottom rack on the right, or the blue one hanging in the center of the right wall? They are all jackets.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes that green hoodie on the back left wall?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt User: The green hoodie hanging up top on the left wall.\\ \tt System: This one is by Downtown Consignment.\\ \tt User: Let's add the blue jeans in the very back to my cart along with the blue jacket in the center of the right wall.\\ \tt System: Ok. I will add those two items right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 15, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 7, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything made by the same brand as that jacket?
