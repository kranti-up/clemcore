Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Greetings! Would you kindly suggest some shirts?\nSystem: I'm sorry, we do not have any shirts.\nUser: Ok, I'm just looking for a gift for my teenage son. How about hats in an XS?\nSystem: Yes, for hats, I can suggest the white ones on the table or the camo one behind those. What are your thoughts?\nUser: No, really don't think my son would like those. He's more understated with his tastes. Can you show me other ones?\nSystem: Unfortunately, those are the only ones we have in an XS.\nUser: Ok, no problem, maybe I will have to introduce him to things he wouldn't usually pick out for himself. Can you tell me more about the first white one and the camo one please?\nSystem: Yes, the white one is available in XS, M, L, S, XXL, XL, while the camo one is available in XS, XXL.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
