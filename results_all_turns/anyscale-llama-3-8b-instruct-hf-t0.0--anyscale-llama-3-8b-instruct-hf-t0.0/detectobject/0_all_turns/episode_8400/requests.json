Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need to get a nice comfy chair, I think a white leather one would be nice.\nSystem: The ottoman in front of the red couch is white leather. What do you think?\nUser: Do you have any others that are cheap and made from wood?\nSystem: I don't have any that fit that search, sorry.\nUser: Ok, which one of these rugs will go best with all my things?\nSystem: You might want to look at the blue one here in the front.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, Lamp, white, NA\n6, Table, wooden, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Thanks. I think what I want to buy is actually the table that's sitting on that rug and the lamp over against the left hand wall."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-c38c4c63-ded7-4d49-8540-3ab616c18a17", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n6\n1", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715917140, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 7, "prompt_tokens": 362, "total_tokens": 369}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 03:38:59.269513", "call_duration": "0:00:01.525112", "response": "ObjectID\n6\n1", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
