Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Would you recommend a green chair for me?\nSystem: No problem! What do you think about the green one in back on this side of the dividing wall.\nUser: Do you have anything in grey that has a similar rating and cost?\nSystem: Sorry, I can't find anything similar.\nUser: Do you have any other chairs at all?\nSystem: Sorry, just that green one I showed you.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n2, Chair, green, NA\n0, Sofa, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok, I'll get that chair.
