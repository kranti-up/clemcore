	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a red and white sweater.\\ \tt System: How about the one second from left on the bottom?\\ \tt User: Who makes the coat in front of the first window and what size is it?\\ \tt System: Sorry, which one?\\ \tt User: Sorry, the coat by the window next to the pants.\\ \tt System: That's a size L from Cats Are Great.\\ \tt User: Let's add cheap to that search.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I found no cheap red and white sweaters.\\ \tt User: Let me get the coat, then.\\ \tt System: I'll put that in your cart.\\ \tt User: Let me get that blue jacket right in front and the tee shirt above it.\\ \tt System: I'll add those to your purchases.\\ \tt User: Do you have a size L blouse?\\ \tt System: I have this grey one on the floor rack on the left and the closest one on the bottom row on the wall as well as the middle one.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
