Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there! Could you help me find a coat today?\nSystem: Of course! How do you like the black one hanging at the top right? Or maybe the other black one hanging in the front of the rack?\nUser: They both look like they would be too long on me and I don't see any others that look shorter. Why don't we move on to tshirts instead? I was hoping for something plain please.\nSystem: Of course! How do you like the dark green one hanging on the left wall?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n2, coat, black, XL\n12, coat, black, L\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: No, I don't like that, not a fan of button shirts. I guess I should go back too looking at coats since I actually need one sooner rather than later.
