	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Looking for a button down today.\\ \tt System: Let me help you find a shirt. Take a look at the green shirt above the camouflage pants, the blue shirt just to the right and the grey shirt on the far right side.\\ \tt User: I'm looking for something in a greyish tone with sleeves that go just to the elbow if you can find that.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I could not find anything that meets your request for a light grey half sleeve shirt.\\ \tt User: Can I get the specs on the red and white sportsman jacket and that black one on the rack?\\ \tt System: The red and white jacket is available in xs and l, is made by Coats & More, has a 3.3 rating, and a twin colors pattern. The price of this jacket is 234.99 and this article is an xs. It's a long sleeved jacket. The black jacket is by Yogi Fit, has a 4.0 rating and sells for 174.99. It's a plain black full sleeve length jacket.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 29, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd really like a jacket by the same brands and with the same colors but in XXL. I really like solid, complementary colors as well.
