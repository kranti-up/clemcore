Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Do you have anything with the same sizes as it, but sleeveless and more affordable?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I don't have anything currently available that fits that description.\nUser: Alright, that's fine. What about a short-sleeve from Uptown Gallery?\nSystem: Unfortunately I don't have anything by that description either. Can I help with something else?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
