Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Could you find some trousers for me in camouflage pattern?\nSystem: What about the green ones shown on the far left compartment?\nUser: Do you have anything else for me to look at?\nSystem: I'm sorry, but nothing else came up.
