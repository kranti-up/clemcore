Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there! I'm looking for some trousers today. Could you suggest a couple please?\nSystem: I can certainly do that. What do you like think about the grey ones to the far left on the wall or the brown ones two to the right of those?\nUser: Not sure, they look a little too baggy for me. Maybe let's look at blouses first then? This is supposed to be clothes for a new office job I got.\nSystem: Of course, what are your thoughts on the white and grey one hanging at the top right or maybe the black and white hanging at the top left. We also have a white and grey one in the center at the top.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n10, dress, purple, L\n0, dress, maroon, L\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: No thank you, they have too much going one.
