	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some small hoodies?\\ \tt System: Sure, I have a brown hoodie on the lower right of the wall display, another brown hoodie on that floor rack, and a blue hoodie next to that. What do you think?\\ \tt User: What brands are the two brown ones? And what sizes are available?\\ \tt System: Both brown hoodies are from 212 Local and are available in S, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt User: Awesome, I'll take both! Please add those to my cart.\\ \tt System: Of course, I'll do so now!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 19, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 17, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 15, coat, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else with a similar pattern to the blue hoodie or the brown one on the wall?
