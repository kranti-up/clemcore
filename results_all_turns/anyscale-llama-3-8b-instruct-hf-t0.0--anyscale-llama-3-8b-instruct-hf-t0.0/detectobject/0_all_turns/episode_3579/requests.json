Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi! I need a jacket with twin colors.\nSystem: What do you think of the red and white jacket?\nUser: Are there any others you'd recommend?\nSystem: Nothing I could find.

Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n9, jacket, red, white, XS\n23, shoes, black, S\n28, shoes, black, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Could you compare the rating of the black shoes to the other black shoes?
