Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you see any good white rugs?\nSystem: You might consider the black and white one in the front under the islands.\nUser: Make sure what you show me has a good rating.\nSystem: Sorry, I can't find a rug like you want with a good rating.\nUser: Ok, how about a chair then?\nSystem: You might like the brown chair on the black and white rug.
