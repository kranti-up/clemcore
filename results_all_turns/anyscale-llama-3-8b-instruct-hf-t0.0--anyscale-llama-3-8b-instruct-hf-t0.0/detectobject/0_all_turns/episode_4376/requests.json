Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey! Really need some help today finding a jacket, could I see what you have with high reviews?\nSystem: Of course, we have a blue and green one third on the middle display, a light grey jacket on the back circular rack and a light blue and green jacket above the blue shoes. What do you think?\nUser: I'm not sure, they all seem like they would be difficult to combine with my other clothes. How about shoes instead? I can always go for a jacket elsewhere.\nSystem: Sure, we have those blue shoes and also the red ones next to them. How do you like those?\nUser: Only two options? Ok, maybe I should just try making a decision with the jackets. Could you tell me how the light blue and green jacket is different from the blue and green jacket please?\nSystem: Yes, the light blue and green jacket is denim, has full length sleeves and a 3.2 customer review. The blue and green one is also denim, has full length sleeves but a 3.9 review!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
