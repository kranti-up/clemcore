	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a coffee table. One that people have already reviewed and liked.\\ \tt System: There are two you could consider. The one to the left by the two lamps or the one on the right by the grey sofa.\\ \tt User: Tell me more. What are they made from? How much are they?\\ \tt System: Both are wood coffee tables priced at .\\ \tt User: Do you have anything by the same brand as the one on the right, but at a better price. Oh, and I think I'd like one that involves leather.\\ \tt System: Sorry, I can't find anything like that.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt 3, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, I guess tell me more about the two you showed me. Ratings and price?
