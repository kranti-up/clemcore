	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Is there a jacket you think I'd like?\\ \tt System: There's a blue jacket in the back right corner, a grey one on the far right of the dresser, and a red and white one in the middle of the dresser.\\ \tt User: Are there any jeans?\\ \tt System: Do you like the dark blue jeans in the middle?\\ \tt User: Do you have something similar to the red and white jacket and blue jacket hanging in the back left dresser?\\ \tt System: Besides that blue one and grey one, there's also a grey jacket in the left middle cubby of the back dresser.\\ \tt User: What is the display size as well as the available sizes of the jeans?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 5, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 15, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The dark blue jeans in the left middle cubby on the right.
