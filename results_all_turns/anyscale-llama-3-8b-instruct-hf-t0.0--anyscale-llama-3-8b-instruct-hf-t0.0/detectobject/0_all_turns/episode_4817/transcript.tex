	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me any blue and green jackets you think are good. But make sure they're in extra extra large.\\ \tt System: Does that denim jacket in the middle of the display shelf appeal to your sense of style?\\ \tt User: I'd like to know the size of that, as well as the range of sizes it can be ordered in.\\ \tt System: Which item would you like to know size information about?\\ \tt User: That denim one in the middle of the display table.\\ \tt System: The jacket pictured there is an extra extra large, but it can also be purchased in extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large.\\ \tt User: Okay gotcha. That black jacket on the far left and that cobalt blue one on the rack at the end of the display shelf are both pretty eye-catching too. I'd appreciate it if you could reel off the sizes those come in as well.\\ \tt System: The black jacket is available in small and extra large, while the blue jacket is exclusively available in large.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt 0, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 13, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'm not sure how to choose. Do you think one of these jackets would go best with what I like to wear?
