	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: How do you feel about any of these shoes?\\ \tt System: What are your thoughts on the red shows on the wall or the black shoes on the center shelf?\\ \tt User: Let me look for something blue.\\ \tt System: Sorry I don't see anything that fits that description. Would you like to shop for something else?\\ \tt User: What's the price on those red shoes?\\ \tt System: Sorry, which shoes are you interested in?\\ \tt User: The red shoes on the back wall.\\ \tt System: Those are by Downtown Consignment and priced at 244.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 56, shoes, red, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, do you think any of these jackets match my style?
