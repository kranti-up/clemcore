Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, winter is coming and I don't have anything warm to wear. Please help me find a coat!\nSystem: I can definitely help! What do you think about the black ones under the red shoeboxes?\nUser: I'm not sure I like those, they look like office jackets. Could you instead tell me the size and brand of the other black one?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which one do you mean?\nUser: The black one under the blue shoeboxes.\nSystem: Yes, that one is XXL and by Modern Arts.\nUser: Might be a little big, but I think I could also get some warm casual pants, do you have joggers in an XL by any chance?\nSystem: Yes, we have some dark green ones, the third at the bottom. What do you think?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.

Maybe I should just look at anything else at this point that I could layer up.
