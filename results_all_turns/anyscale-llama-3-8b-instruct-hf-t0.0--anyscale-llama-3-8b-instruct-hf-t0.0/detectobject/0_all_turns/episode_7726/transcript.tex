	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What are the chances you could find me a nice long-sleeved black coat?\\ \tt System: I've got two beautiful options hanging up on the top row on the far right! How do those look to you?\\ \tt User: Well, they're beautiful, but I guess I should have added that I can't afford to spend a lot.\\ \tt System: The blue jacket on the top row and the blue jacket and the light grey jacket on the bottom row meet your budget needs! Can you see yourself wearing any of those?\\ \tt User: I do kind of like that blue one hanging up on top, but like I said, today is not a day for splurging. Can you find me some affordable options like it?\\ \tt System: You might be surprised by how doable that one is! The blue and grey options on the bottom row are the other affordable jackets I can offer you today.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 4, coat, black, L\\ \tt 3, coat, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually, maybe it really is worth investing in a quality coat. Can you tell me what sizes you have of those two black ones?
