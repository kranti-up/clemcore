Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new dress. Show me what you've got!\nSystem: Ok! How do you feel about these? I have a black dress on the very left, another black dress next to it, and a purple dress on the right side of the same floor rack.\nUser: Those are possibilities. What about a blouse, size L?\nSystem: Sure! I have a grey and white blouse on the bottom right of the right wall, another grey and white blouse two down from it, and a maroon, white, and blue blouse on the top right.\nUser: Ok, I'll think about those too. In the meantime, could you compare that second black dress to the olive one in the back?\nSystem: Of course! The black dress costs .99 and the olive one costs .99.\nUser: Great, thanks! What sizes do they come in?\nSystem: Could you clarify which items you're referring to?\nUser: The second black dress and the olive dress.\nSystem: Ok, the black dress comes in size L only, but the olive dress is available in sizes XS, S, L, and XXL.\nUser: Ok, is there anything more you can tell me about them?\nSystem: Both dresses are shown in size L. The black dress is rated 4.5, compared to the olive dress which is rated just 3.6.\nUser: Ok, thank you! Now, could you show me some t-shirts in size L?\nSystem: Yes, what are your thoughts on this brown t-shirt in the top center?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
