	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to get a sweater. Do you have any with good reviews?\\ \tt System: I have three sweaters on the display table. What do you think of the two pink ones or the red and black?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the price and rating of the red and black sweater and the pink one in front?\\ \tt System: Both have a rating of 4.5. The red and black costs 239.99 and the pink 169.99.\\ \tt User: Will you tell me the rating and brand of the red and black sweater?\\ \tt System: Which sweater do you mean?\\ \tt User: The red and black sweater in back on the display table.\\ \tt System: It has a 4.5 rating and is from River Chateau.\\ \tt User: Can you show me some plain full sleeve coats?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the brown coat hanging on the wall?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 26, sweater, red, black, XXL\\ \tt 22, sweater, pink, M\\ \tt 25, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 70, blouse, white, black, S\\ \tt 46, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 48, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Will you add the pink sweater in front and the grey and brown shirt in back to my cart?
