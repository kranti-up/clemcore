Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me the coat that will fit in best with my overall style?\nSystem: You may want to consider three coats.

The one hanging closer to us in L. The one hanging further away is in XL.\nUser: OK, so can you show me coats like these two but in green and in size M?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I have no coats that fit these parameters.
