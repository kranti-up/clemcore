Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a super affordable jacket.\nSystem: Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that at the moment. Would you like to look for anything else?\nUser: Do you have more jackets like the red and white one on the top right and the blue one to the left of it?\nSystem: The grey jacket on our left would be similar, as would the leftmost  blue jacket in the top row  and the light grey jacket  hanging second in the bottom row on the wall on the right.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n4, jacket, red, white, XS\n3, jacket, blue, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Thanks. Is the red and white jacket on the right by a good brand, and what's its size?"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-b47607bf-58fe-4fa8-ad71-a1fd2c7ee8bb", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n4", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715916753, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 363}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 03:32:31.914616", "call_duration": "0:00:01.944979", "response": "ObjectID\n4", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
