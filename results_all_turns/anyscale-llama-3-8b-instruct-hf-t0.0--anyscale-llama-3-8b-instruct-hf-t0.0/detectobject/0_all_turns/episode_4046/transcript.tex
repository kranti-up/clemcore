	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me coats with high ratings only?\\ \tt System: Do you like the black one hanging up on the right wall, the brown one on the center front rack, or the black one next to it? They are all coats with high ratings.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the black one up on the wall and the brown one on the rack for me?\\ \tt System: The one on the wall is a large black coat rated 4.8. The one on the rack is an extra large brown coat rated 4.1.\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy the pink sweater in the top left cubby and the brown pants down below.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll add that sweater and those pants to your cart for you.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, coat, black, L\\ \tt 38, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 5, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 35, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Great. Do you have any knit sweaters to show me?
