Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Think you can find something like it by that brand?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I do not see any Yogi Fit sweaters similar to that one.\nUser: Alright, well could you check for something by Uptown Gallery? I'd consider that brand as long as it's got top reviews.\nSystem: I apologize, but I do not see any sweaters by that brand either. Is there something else I can offer my assistance with?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
