	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need to find a M sized jacket, can you help?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the blue jacket on the left, the grey one on the right, or the blue and green next to it?\\ \tt User: What about a vest?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey and white  vest on the far right?\\ \tt User: Can you show me anything with a similar sleeve length and pattern as the black and olive dress on the rack?\\ \tt System: I have that black and olive dress in addition to the olive dress and the grey, both on the same rack.\\ \tt User: How much for the grey jacket? And what is the rating, too?\\ \tt System: Which jacket do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 12, dress, black, olive, S\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The grey one on the table to the right.
