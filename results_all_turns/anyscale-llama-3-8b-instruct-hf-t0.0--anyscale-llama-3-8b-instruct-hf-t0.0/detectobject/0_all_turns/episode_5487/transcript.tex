	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey there, could you point out a hat with a good customer rating for me?  I don't want it stretching out or falling apart in the back.\\ \tt System: How do you like the black hat between the two white ones, or the one closest to you?  The black and orange one would also be a good choice- all three of these hats have good customer ratings.\\ \tt User: Maybe I'll get a coat first.  What sizes are the black coat in the far shelves in the back right of the room and the one in the second nearest cubby available in?  Could you tell me how much they are too?\\ \tt System: The near coat is available in sizes XS, M, L, XL, and XXL, and costs .99.  The far coat is available only in size XL, and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Is there anything similar to the near one?\\ \tt System: Sure, the grey coat near it and the grey coat in the back of the room by the other black coat are both similar.  Do either of them interest you?\\ \tt User: Actually, I'm gonna go with the very farthest grey coat on the right, and the olive white shirt in the first cubby past the mirror on the right.\\ \tt System: Certainly, I've added both to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, coat, black, L\\ \tt 12, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 11, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 14, shirt, olive, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I want another of that grey coat too, add one more.
