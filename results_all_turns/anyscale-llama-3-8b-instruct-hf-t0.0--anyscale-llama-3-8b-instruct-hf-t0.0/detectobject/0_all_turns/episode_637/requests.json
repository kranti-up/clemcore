Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me find some nice jeans?\nSystem: Have a look at the three pairs on the bottom right of the display.\nUser: I like the two farthest right.

And what sizes do you have?\nSystem: Sorry, for which item?\nUser: Sorry, the dark blue ones second from the right.\nSystem: Ok, those are an XS and have a 4.7 rating.\nUser: I think I'd rather get a shirt.
