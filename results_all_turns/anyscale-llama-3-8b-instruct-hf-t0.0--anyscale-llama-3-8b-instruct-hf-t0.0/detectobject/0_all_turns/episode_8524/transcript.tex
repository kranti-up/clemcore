	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a coffee table. Show me some, please.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey coffee table and the wooden coffee table?\\ \tt User: Actually, I would rather you tell me the price of the black end tables and what they are made out of.\\ \tt System: What are you talking about?\\ \tt User: I'm talking about the black end tables on either side of the red sofa.\\ \tt System: They are both made out of wood and cost .\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt 2, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Show me something like black end table but made out of wool and in color white.
