	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: How about an XXL blouse?\\ \tt System: I can help you find an XXL blouse today. I have the grey and white one on the top right, the green and purple one next to it, and the pink one underneath it.\\ \tt User: Can you show me something with a similar rating and size as the grey and white one but made by Yogi Fit and in pink and white?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, blouse, grey, white, XL\\ \tt 5, blouse, pink, white, XL\\ \tt 6, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you compare the pink and white one with the grey and white one for me?
