Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Alright, alright, alright!  I need a new hat, could you help me narrow it down if you've got a free second?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the black and white hats closest to you on the left shelf?  If you do want a lighter color, the white hat on the right shelf would also be a good option.\nUser: Hold it, hold everything.  Let's get a coat first.  What am I looking at for coats?\nSystem: Take a look at the black coat hanging on the rack just past the left hat display, or the black coat across from it on the other rack.  Are either of those of any interest?  If you're looking for a more professional look, the brown coat on the near left rack would be an excellent choice as well.\nUser: None of them are really grabbing me, do you have anything else you can show me?\nSystem: Sure, there's also another black coat next to the first one I mentioned, and one in the far cubby on the left side of the room that you might be able to get a better look at.  I also have a grey coat in the near cubby on your right that you might be interested in.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
