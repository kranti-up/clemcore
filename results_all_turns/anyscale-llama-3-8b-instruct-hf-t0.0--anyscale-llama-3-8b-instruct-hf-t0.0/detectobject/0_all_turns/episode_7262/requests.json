Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm browsing for a basic sweatshirt with decent reviews.\nSystem: I have several options for you to consider. Tell me how you like that green one in the second brown cubby from the left, the brown one in the cubby to the left of that, and the green one hanging on the rack in front to the right.\nUser: Huh I kind of dig that brown one, and it wouldn't hurt to have a nice green as well. Get me that green one on the rack and the brown one please.\nSystem: I will happily put those sweatshirts in your cart for you.\nUser: Oops I probably should have made sure they're available in my size. And I'd like to know the ratings before I run my card.\nSystem: I'm sorry, but which item are you asking about?\nUser: The brown hoodie in the cubby and the green one hanging on the rack to the right.\nSystem: That brown sweatshirt is available in sizes small, extra large, and extra extra large, and customers have on average rated it a 4.0. The green comes in large, small, and medium and is rated a 2.8.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
