	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi. Which shoes will match my wardrobe the best?\\ \tt System: Tell me what you think  of the black and white shoes on the leftmost shelf below the hats.\\ \tt User: Compare the size and brand of the black coat in the second rack from the left and the black one in the back left dresser, second cubby from the left.\\ \tt System: They're both in XL and by Pedals & Gears.\\ \tt User: Could you go ahead and add the grey coat in the rack in the back right to my cart, along with the black had sitting on the left shelf, second from the front.\\ \tt System: Sure, I'll add those now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 60, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 2, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 67, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 76, hat, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Also, give me the price and ratings of the black coat?
