Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I want a new couch, can you help?\nSystem: Of course! What do you think of the red one facing away on the geometric rug or the grey one in the group behind it?\nUser: I like the rugs you have. Do you have any others by the same people as that geometric one or the grey one back by the partition?\nSystem: You did see the grey one by the wall? Just those.\nUser: Bummer. How about a chair in my style?\nSystem: The one on the grey rug may interest you.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n8, AreaRug, white, NA\n5, AreaRug, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Nah.
