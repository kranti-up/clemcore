Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Both are from Art Den.\nUser: Can you tell me the brand and customer rating of them?\nSystem: Well, as I said, both are from Art Den, and both have a 3.8 customer rating.\nUser: I'm interested in something like those tables, but with a good rating.\nSystem: Well, 3.8 is considered a good rating, so both tables have a good rating.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
