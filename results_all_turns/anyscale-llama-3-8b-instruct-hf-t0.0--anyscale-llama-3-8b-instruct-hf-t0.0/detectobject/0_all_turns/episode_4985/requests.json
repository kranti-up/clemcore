Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: In your expert opinion, would one of the jackets here go particularly well with the clothes I routinely wear?\nSystem: I think you might be enamored with this grey jacket up front to the right, the red and white jacket at the left end of that rack in the middle of the floor, or the black option at the right end of the bottom row in the back near the windows.\nUser: Wait I'm sorry. I think I meant a coat.\nSystem: In that case, turn your attention to the black coat hanging above the striped shirts in the back, the other black coat on the other side of that green sweater, and the brown coat to the left of those past the brown shirt.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n26, hoodie, green, S\n32, hoodie, blue, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Wait, I changed my mind again. I want something along the lines of that green hoodie up front near the red and white jacket from before."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-5c751d4f-a27b-4067-b3d3-105f49f4794b", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n26", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715911817, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 5, "prompt_tokens": 402, "total_tokens": 407}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:10:15.864243", "call_duration": "0:00:01.350378", "response": "ObjectID\n26", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
