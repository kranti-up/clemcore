	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any shirts I could wear out in here?\\ \tt System: Why don't you take a look at the black and white shirts on your left, as well as this black and white blouse behind the grey jacket.\\ \tt User: Could you get brand and size information for the black and white ones?\\ \tt System: Which items are you asking about?\\ \tt User: I'm talking about the blouse in the back left and this one in the rack.\\ \tt System: The brand and size of the blouse in the back is Downtown Consignment and S. And the blouse on the rack is by HairDo and is in M.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, blouse, white, black, S\\ \tt 17, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like something in similar sizes and sleeve length the white and black blouses on the left. However I'd like something a bit less expensive and by HairDo please.
