	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there, do you have any vests with good ratings?\\ \tt System: I sure do!  There's a white vest hanging on the wall, right bestide the bright blue coat.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the red and purple sweaters folded on the table?\\ \tt System: Sure, the red one is size M, while the purple one is an XS.\\ \tt User: Are any of these items from The Vegan Baker?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything from that brand.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the ratings of the dark grey blouse please?\\ \tt System: Sorry, which blouse was that?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, sweater, purple, XS\\ \tt 13, sweater, red, M\\ \tt 1, blouse, dark grey, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The one  hanging above the vest.
