	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any affordable blouses in maroon, white and blue?\\ \tt System: How about this blouse on the top right of the wall display?\\ \tt User: How about something similar to the black dress to my left in price and available sizes?\\ \tt System: Sorry I do not, would you like to see something else?\\ \tt User: How about something with light spots?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything with that pattern.\\ \tt User: How about a hoodie?\\ \tt System: What do you think of this green hoodie on the left?\\ \tt User: What are the sizes and ratings of this sweater?\\ \tt System: Which one are you asking about?\\ \tt User: The pink sweater in the top middle of the wall display.\\ \tt System: That comes in S, M, and L, and is rated 3.8.\\ \tt User: Can you help me to find an expensive sweater?\\ \tt System: How about the black one in the bottom middle of the table display, or the purple one on the middle of the table, and lastly the grey one just in front of it?\\ \tt User: I'll take one of the purple sweater.\\ \tt System: Okay, it has been added.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like the pink sweater in sleeve length?\\ \tt System: There is the grey and black one on the right middle of the table, the dark grey one on the top section, or the black one on the bottom section.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 16, dress, black, L\\ \tt 7, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 74, sweater, purple, XS\\ \tt 68, sweater, dark grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What are the ratings on that sweater?
