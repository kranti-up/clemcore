	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like a sleeveless vest with good ratings.\\ \tt System: I have this white one on the bottom of the back wall.\\ \tt User: Do you have something in the same and for the same price as the blue jacket next to it or the light grey one up above, but in blue?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that.\\ \tt User: Ok. Let's add those jeans on the right side of the front table to my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok. I will add those now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 20, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 4, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 10, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes those?
