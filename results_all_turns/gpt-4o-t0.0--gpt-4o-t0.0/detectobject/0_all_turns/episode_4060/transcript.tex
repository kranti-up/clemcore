	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there, how's it going?  Could you give me some recommendations for a cozy sweater?\\ \tt System: Sure, how do you like the pink sweater on the top row to your right?  If you're looking for something darker, I can also offer the black sweater on its right, or if you just want another color the green sweater on the table to your left is also available.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in size XXL?\\ \tt System: Sure, the black sweater in front of the green one I mentioned is size XXL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 7, shirt, white, grey, L\\ \tt 6, sweater, black, S\\ \tt 2, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Alright, I've had a chance to think now, I'm gonna do the grey jacket to the left of the pink sweater, for my boyfriend, and the white and grey shirt on the table next to the green sweater.   Add those both to my cart, please.
