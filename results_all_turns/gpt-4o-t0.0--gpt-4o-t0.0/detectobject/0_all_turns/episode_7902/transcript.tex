	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please shout out some suggestions for shirts.\\ \tt System: Is that striped black and white shirt or the grey and white shirt to the left a good match for your style?\\ \tt User: Hm yeah those are both maybes. Can you highlight some of their differences for me?\\ \tt System: The black and white one is a Garden Retail tshirt that is available in extra large. It has heavy vertical stripes and full sleeves and has on average been rated a 4.0. The item pictured here is an extra large. The price of this item is .99. The grey and white tshirt is by Downtown Stylists and has vertical stripes and half-length sleeves. It has on average been rated slightly higher, at 4.2. It is pictured here in a medium but also is available in extra small, extra large, and extra extra large. This shirt sells for .99.\\ \tt User: Cool now I'd like to look for hoodies with high ratings.\\ \tt System: That green hoodie hanging on the wall comes highly rated, as does the blue hoodie above and to the right of it. Could you see yourself sporting either of those?\\ \tt User: Are there further options?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I do not have any more hoodies to recommend. Is there something else you would like assistance with?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, shirt, black, white, XL\\ \tt 7, shirt, white, grey, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll just go ahead and buy that white and grey shirt and the black and white shirt on the left. Would you mind adding those to my cart?
