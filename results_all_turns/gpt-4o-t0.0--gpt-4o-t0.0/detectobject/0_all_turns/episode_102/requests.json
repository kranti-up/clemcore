Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello, are there any yellow and white tank tops with good ratings?\nSystem: There is one, it's hanging up on the wall at the back of the room.\nUser: Is there something like that one but in black and olive?\nSystem: Unfortunately not right now.  Is there anything else you're after?\nUser: Yea, are there any coats with an affordable price tag?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think of the grey coat hanging up at the top left beside the holiday sweater?\nUser: It's not bad.  I like that blouse hanging up at the top at the very back of the room, can you put it in my cart please?  I also want the beige dress on the rack in the middle of the room.\nSystem: Awesome, I'll add both of those to your cart straight away.\nUser: Is there anything in XL?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything matching that search.\nUser: Do you have any blouses with a leafy design pattern?\nSystem: I do, what do you think of the green, violet and pink blouse underneath the gold shoe boxes?\nUser: It's ok.  I'd actually like to see plain patterned items with an affordable price point.\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything like that.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
