Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm looking to buy some luxury jeans that have reviewers falling head over heels.\nSystem: Those two jeans in the back to the left are a match!

The darker pair also comes highly recommended, with an average score of 4.6.\nUser: Good to know.
