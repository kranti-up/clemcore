	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Let's look at coats to match my clothes.\\ \tt System: Do you like the grey one hanging on the wall to the left? It is a coat.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the prices and brands of the black dress in the back left and the black dress on the right wall?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The black dress in the far back left and the black dress hanging on the right wall.\\ \tt System: The one on the left is by Pedals & Gears and costs .99. The one on the right wall is by Home Store and costs .99.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see options in black with good reviews.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have any black coats with good reviews.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, dress, black, M\\ \tt 7, dress, black, M\\ \tt 14, blouse, violet, XL\\ \tt 15, blouse, white, red, violet, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizes of the multicolored blouse hanging in the front left and the purple blouse hanging on the bottom center of the wall?
