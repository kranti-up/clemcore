	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi hi, would you be so kind as to point me in the direction of some joggers?  If you have anything by Downtown Consignment that would be awesome.\\ \tt System: How do you like the dark green joggers in the near cubby on your right?  They are by Downtown Consignment.\\ \tt User: Those might be the ones, but let's come back to that.  Could you show me a hoodie or two?\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think of the brown hoodie right above the joggers?\\ \tt User: How much is it, and what are the reviews like?\\ \tt System: Which garment are you asking about?\\ \tt User: The brown hoodie above the dark green joggers.\\ \tt System: That hoodie is priced at .99, and has a customer rating of 4.0.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: That sounds pretty good to me, throw it in my cart.
