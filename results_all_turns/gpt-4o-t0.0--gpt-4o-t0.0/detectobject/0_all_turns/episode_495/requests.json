Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like some advice on buying a dark blue pair of jeans with excellent ratings.\nSystem: Those two pairs of jeans to the right on the shelves are a match for your criteria!\nUser: What sizes does that pair come in?

There are no other Modern Arts jeans, sorry.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
