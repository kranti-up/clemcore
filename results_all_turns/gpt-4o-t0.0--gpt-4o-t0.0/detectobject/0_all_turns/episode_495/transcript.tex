	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some advice on buying a dark blue pair of jeans with excellent ratings.\\ \tt System: Those two pairs of jeans to the right on the shelves are a match for your criteria!\\ \tt User: What sizes does that pair come in? And do other folks have good things to say about it?\\ \tt System: Would you mind identifying more precisely which pair of jeans have caught your eye?\\ \tt User: The pair on the far right.\\ \tt System: Those jeans are offered in extra small, small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. They have been awarded an impressive rating of 4.7.\\ \tt User: Awesome. Let me think about those for a little while. For now can you show me some grey shirts?\\ \tt System: There is a grey shirt folded up on the table to the right in between a red sweater and a grey and white striped shirt. See if that one works for you.\\ \tt User: I'm thinking too much about those jeans to consider other items right now. I'm wondering if there's anything similar by the brand that makes them?\\ \tt System: That brand also makes the pair to the right of them.\\ \tt User: Is that all?\\ \tt System: Yes. There are no other Modern Arts jeans, sorry.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 46, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Understood. I'd also be down to check out a few highly rated hoodies.
