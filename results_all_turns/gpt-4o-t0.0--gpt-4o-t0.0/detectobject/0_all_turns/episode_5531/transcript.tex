	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello! Is there a Pedals & Gears coat you'd recommend for me?\\ \tt System: There's that black coat hanging in the very front left here.\\ \tt User: Is there a black jacket in S?\\ \tt System: The black one I just showed you right in the front here is a S.\\ \tt User: Compare the available sizes and prices of the green, violet, and pink blouse second from the back left, as well as the light grey blouse in the bottom front left.\\ \tt System: The green, violet, and pink one comes in S, L, and XXL and costs .99. The light grey one comes in M and costs .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, blouse, green, violet, pink, XXL\\ \tt 10, blouse, light grey, M\\ \tt 7, dress, black, XL\\ \tt 1, jacket, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Is there anything else?
