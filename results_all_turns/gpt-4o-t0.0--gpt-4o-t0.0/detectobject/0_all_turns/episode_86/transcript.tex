	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you recommend a blouse that goes with my style?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the maroon, white, and blue blouse on the left, the white and black on the right, or the grey and white in the middle?\\ \tt User: Any other suggestions?\\ \tt System: I also have another maroon, white, and blue blouse and a light grey in the middle of the shelf.\\ \tt User: Do you have any XS jeans?\\ \tt System: I have three pairs of jeans, one in dark blue and two in grey.\\ \tt User: What can you tell me about the available sizes of maroon, white, and blue blouse in the middle and the grey and white?\\ \tt System: The former comes in XXL, S, XL, and L. The latter is available in M, L, XS, and XL.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the cost and available sizes of the black cost on the right and the grey on the left?\\ \tt System: The black costs 139.99 and comes in L, XXL, XS, and M. The grey costs 59.99 and is available in L, XS, and XXL.\\ \tt User: Can I see some jeans?\\ \tt System: I have a grey pair of jeans on the left and a dark blue beside them.\\ \tt User: Can you get me the available sizes and ratings of the maroon, white, and blue blouse and the light grey one?\\ \tt System: Which blouses do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 7, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 10, coat, black, L\\ \tt 4, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 6, blouse, light grey, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The maroon, white, and blue blouse and the light grey, both in the center shelf.
