	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you tell me which dress I should buy to go best with my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: There are several on the center rack in the back that you might be interested in, two purple ones and a maroon one.\\ \tt User: What brands are the maroon one and the closer purple one.\\ \tt System: The maroon one is from North Lodge and the purple one is from Modern Arts.\\ \tt User: Ok, thanks. I want to look at jackets too. Do you have any short sleeve ones from Home Store that are in a similar price range to that blue one on the back wall? The one second from the right in the top row.\\ \tt System: Sorry, I can't find anything like that. Can I help with anything else?\\ \tt User: How about a nice plain dress?\\ \tt System: The closer of the purple ones I showed you earlier is an option. There's also an olive one to the left of it and a black one in the far back right corner on the wall.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me more about the reviews on the olive one and the black on?\\ \tt System: The black one is rated 2.6 and the olive one is rated 3.6.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 36, dress, purple, XXL\\ \tt 21, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 28, dress, black, M\\ \tt 34, dress, olive, L\\ \tt 11, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 9, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I don't know. Let's change over to sweaters, I need one of those too. Do you have any knit ones?
