	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find a jacket that matches my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: Check out the black jacket hanging up on the top right against the wall and the brown one hanging up on the bottom left.\\ \tt User: I think instead I'd like to get something like the pink sweater on the table, the one on the front row, second from the right, as well as the green one on the far right side of the back row. I'm looking for a similar brand but in the colors grey and brown.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, nothing came up as a match for that.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 22, sweater, pink, M\\ \tt 20, sweater, green, XL\\ \tt 28, tshirt, violet, XXL\\ \tt 36, tshirt, red, XS\\ \tt 46, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you show me anything else?
