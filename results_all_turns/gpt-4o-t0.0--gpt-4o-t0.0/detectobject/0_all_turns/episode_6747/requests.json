Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Would you recommend an area rug to me?\nSystem: What do you think of the white rug in the center of the room?\nUser: I only want to see rugs with good customer ratings.\nSystem: Apologies, but there are no area rugs like that.\nUser: OK, in that case how about adding the white end table and wooden shelf to my cart.\nSystem: Confirmed.
