	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have nice light sweatpants here?\\ \tt System: I have one pair, in dark green. You will see it on the right  in the second cupboard.\\ \tt User: I like them! Please drag them into my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure! I am doing so as we speak.\\ \tt User: What else can offer me?\\ \tt System: I am sorry, there is nothing else. Can I help you in any other way?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 30, joggers, dark green, XL\\ \tt 34, dress, red, XL\\ \tt 29, dress, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yeah, can you help me compare the red dress and teh black one on the floor hanger further away from us?  They hang facing us.
