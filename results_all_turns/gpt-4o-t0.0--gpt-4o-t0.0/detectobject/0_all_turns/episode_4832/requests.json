Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

And the blue one next to the black one you mentioned is also quite nice, add that as well.\nSystem: Certainly, I've added both garments to your cart.\nUser: What's the difference between those two in my cart anyway?\nSystem: The light blue and green jacket is available in sizes XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL, while the blue jacket is available only in size L.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
