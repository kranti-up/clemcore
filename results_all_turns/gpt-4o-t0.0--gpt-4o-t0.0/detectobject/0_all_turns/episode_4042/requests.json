Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me a nice knit sweatshirt?\nSystem: Sure!

Also, can you show me more dresses that cost about the same as the red one in the corner on the right and have a similar pattern?\nSystem: Certainly! Start with the brown dress in the same row as the red one but on the right, then move on to the floor rack further away from us and find the beige dress on the right and the olive one facing the entrance.\nUser: Thanks! What else here is highly rated?\nSystem: Take a look at three other dresses on that floor rack: the black and olive one on the left, another black and olive one facing us, and the black dress on the right.\nUser: OK, any nice sleeveless tops with low necklines?\nSystem: I can offer you the red and white one in the cupboard on the left.
