Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there, good morning!  I'm looking for some sweaters on the cheaper side.  Could you give me some suggestions?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the pink sweater in the third cubby from the front door?  It is in the cheap price range.\nUser: That's cute, I might come back to that.  What about the green blouse in that same cubby, and the white one in the far cubby?  Could you tell me what sizes those two are available in?\nSystem: Certainly.  The green blouse is available in sizes XS, S, and XL, while the white blouse is available in sizes S, L, and XXL.\nUser: Alright, let's go with the green one.
