	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Good morning, I'm looking to do some early shopping today, before my kids wake up, so I need your help! Could you help me find a wooden table please? Ours is too small now.\\ \tt System: I would be happy to help! How do you like one to the right?\\ \tt User: I'm not sure, it looks a little too plain for my taste, do you have something by Modern Arts?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, we do not have anything by Modern Arts in wood.\\ \tt User: Ok, I don't want to run out of time without purchasing something, so I'll take the one you recommended.\\ \tt System: Great! I will add that to your cart now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, Table, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Oh, actually, do you have a table in the same brand as that one but with high ratings and maybe cheaper?
