	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a jacket.\\ \tt System: I would like to show you three jackets. Starting from the right-hand cupboard, take a look at the brown jacket on the right and the black one on the left. In the left-hand cupboard, check out the grey jacket in the middle of the second compartment.\\ \tt User: Do you know what size that black jacket is and do you have customer reviews for it?\\ \tt System: Which jacket are you looking at?\\ \tt User: I am interested in the black jacket in the right-hand side cupboard, the leftmost one there.\\ \tt System: Got it! Thank you. That jacket is shown in size L. It enjoys a rating of 4.8.\\ \tt User: Nice! For now, I am taking the grey jeans in the third shelf from the right in the left-hand cupboard and the blue and black pair in the second shelf from the left in the right-hand cupboard.\\ \tt System: Sure! You should see them in your cart now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, coat, black, L\\ \tt 6, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 10, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Thanks! Can you tell me how they differ?
