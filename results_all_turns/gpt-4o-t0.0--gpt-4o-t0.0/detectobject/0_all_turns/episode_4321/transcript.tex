	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What jacket would go with my clothing style?\\ \tt System: What are your thoughts on the black jacket next to the blue item in the top left case, the black jacket to the right of that, or the grey and white jacket at the very right end?\\ \tt User: Hm, not bad. Could you compare their prices and brands for me?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: Sorry, the two black ones from earlier. The ones to the left.\\ \tt System: Both are .99 and from Yogi Fit.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 7, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 32, tshirt, brown, white, S\\ \tt 6, tshirt, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Anything like the brown and white shirt in the center rack and the blue shirt next to the black jacket from earlier, but in grey and white and more expensive?
