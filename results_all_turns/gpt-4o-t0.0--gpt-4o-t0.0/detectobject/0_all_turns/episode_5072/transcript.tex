	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need pants made by Pedals & Gears.\\ \tt System: Do you like these blue ones on the left side of the wall?\\ \tt User: Can you compare the white t-shirt on the rack and the white and black striped t-shirt on the back wall for me?\\ \tt System: The one on the rack is available in XS, S, M, XL and XXL.  The one against the wall is available in XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizes and ratings of the green t-shirt up top on the left and the orange one up top on the right?\\ \tt System: Which ones do you mean?\\ \tt User: The neon green one on the left and the orange one on the right.\\ \tt System: The one on the left is rated 2.8 and is available in sizes XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL. The one on the right is rated 3.9 and is rated XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 22, tshirt, white, XS\\ \tt 18, tshirt, white, black, XL\\ \tt 0, tshirt, green, L\\ \tt 5, tshirt, orange, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: How about some coats?
