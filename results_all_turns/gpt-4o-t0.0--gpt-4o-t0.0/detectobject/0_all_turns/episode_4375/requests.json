Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey! Really need some help today finding a jacket, could I see what you have with high reviews?\nSystem: Of course, we have a blue and green one third on the middle display, a light grey jacket on the back circular rack and a light blue and green jacket above the blue shoes. What do you think?\nUser: I'm not sure, they all seem like they would be difficult to combine with my other clothes. How about shoes instead? I can always go for a jacket elsewhere.\nSystem: Sure, we have those blue shoes and also the red ones next to them. How do you like those?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n13, jacket, light blue, light green, M\n2, jacket, blue, green, XXL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Only two options?
