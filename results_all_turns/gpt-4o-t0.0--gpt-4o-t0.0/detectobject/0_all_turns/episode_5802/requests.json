Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there! Could you help me find a coat today?\nSystem: Of course! How do you like the black one hanging at the top right? Or maybe the other black one hanging in the front of the rack?\nUser: They both look like they would be too long on me and I don't see any others that look shorter. Why don't we move on to tshirts instead? I was hoping for something plain please.\nSystem: Of course! How do you like the dark green one hanging on the left wall?\nUser: No, I don't like that, not a fan of button shirts. I guess I should go back too looking at coats since I actually need one sooner rather than later. Could you tell me the price and sizes of the black ones?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which ones did you mean?\nUser: The ones you recommended earlier, on the right wall and on the rack.\nSystem: Yes, the one on the wall is .99 and a size XL, while the one on the rack is .99 and a size L.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
