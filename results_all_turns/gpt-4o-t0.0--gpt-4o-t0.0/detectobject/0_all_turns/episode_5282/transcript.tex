	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find an expensive, short-sleeve blouse?\\ \tt System: We don't have any expensive blouses that have short sleeves.\\ \tt User: How does the gray jacket in the upper left compare to the brown jacket in the upper right?\\ \tt System: The grey jacket is leather and has a 3.8 rating, and the brown jacket has a plain pattern and a 3.5 rating.\\ \tt User: What are their brands?\\ \tt System: To which ones are you referring?\\ \tt User: The gray jacket and the brown jacket I asked about earlier.\\ \tt System: The grey jacket is from Art News Today, and the brown jacket is from Coats & More.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt 6, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Please add both the brown jacket and the gray jacket to my cart.
