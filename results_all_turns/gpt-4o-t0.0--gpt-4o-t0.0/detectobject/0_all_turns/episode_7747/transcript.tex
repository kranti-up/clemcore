	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a new dress for my birthday party.\\ \tt System: Right here I've got the beige dress, the dark brown one, and the purple one.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the price and rating for the brown one and the beige one?\\ \tt System: The beige one is 229.99 and has a 4.3, the brown one is 24.99 and has a 4.7.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything by HairDo in XS?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately I've got no HairDo dresses in XS.\\ \tt User: Can I get the brand and size for those two?\\ \tt System: For which two?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, dress, dark brown, M\\ \tt 3, dress, beige, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The brown one and the beige one.
