	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any jeans around here that you would approve of?\\ \tt System: Those grey jeans in the very back to the left and the dark blue jeans on the right would both be wise purchases.\\ \tt User: Oh wait can we talk hats first? I can't stop looking at the dark green one next to the black and orange cap on the left, and I'm also really digging that first camo option on the right. Can I have you get me the sizes of those? And which is more budget-friendly?\\ \tt System: The camo hat is an extra small and costs less, at .99. The green hat on the left is an extra extra large priced at .99.\\ \tt User: That's not too bad. I'll take both! Chuck them in the cart if you don't mind.\\ \tt System: Great! I'll put those hats in your cart for you straight away.\\ \tt User: Actually, hold on. I wanna know if there's anything in the same size and pattern as that camo one but with higher ratings.\\ \tt System: Perhaps you'd also like to consider the other camo cap right next to it!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 73, hat, green, XS\\ \tt 71, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt 72, hat, green, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yeah I was wondering about that one. What do those two cost?
