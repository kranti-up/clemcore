	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi! Are there any white couch chairs that you think I'd like?\\ \tt System: What do you think about the white couch chair up front here?\\ \tt User: Anything similar to the white area rug under the red sofa and the grey rug in the back right, but cheap?\\ \tt System: Sorry, nothing we have is similar to those. Do you want anything else?\\ \tt User: Add the red sofa and grey rug to my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok, adding those now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, AreaRug, white, NA\\ \tt 5, AreaRug, grey, NA\\ \tt 6, Sofa, red, NA\\ \tt 0, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Also, add that grey sofa in the very back to the left.
