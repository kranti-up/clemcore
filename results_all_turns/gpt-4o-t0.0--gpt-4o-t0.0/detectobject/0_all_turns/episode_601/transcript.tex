	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a blouse.\\ \tt System: I've got these last two on the top right and the last one in the second to last cubicle on the left.\\ \tt User: Have you got a blouse with the same design and pattern as the one in the cubicle or the last one on the upper right?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, those are the only ones with those same features.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything plain or checkered?\\ \tt System: No blouses fit that description.\\ \tt User: How about a well built coat?\\ \tt System: I have the two lighter colored ones on the left wall and one on the back of the carousel, take a look.\\ \tt User: How does that last one match up with the one on the top left in price and ratings?\\ \tt System: The one on the wall sells for .99 with a 3.8 rating and the other one lists for .99 with a 4.1 rating.\\ \tt User: I need a size L jacket.\\ \tt System: I have the last one in the second cubicle and the blue one on the carousel.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 39, blouse, white, red, violet, XL\\ \tt 16, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 23, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 50, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 59, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 68, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll take both please.
