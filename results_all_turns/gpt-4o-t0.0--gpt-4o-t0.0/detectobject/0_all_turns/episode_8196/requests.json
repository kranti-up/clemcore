Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Please point out coats that are rated as good.\nSystem: Two of the black coats on the circular rack, one on the right and one on the left, have that rating. So does the grey  one on the wall cubby above the camouflage pants.\nUser: Of any of the coats, which would match what I usually wear?\nSystem: I'd suggest the medium grey on the wall above the camouflage pants, the grey one on the front of the hanging rack, and the black one on the right side of that rack.\nUser: I sort of like the black one. Do you have more like it?\nSystem: Similar items are the light grey coat on the wall, the brown one behind it, and the grey coat on the front of the rack.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
