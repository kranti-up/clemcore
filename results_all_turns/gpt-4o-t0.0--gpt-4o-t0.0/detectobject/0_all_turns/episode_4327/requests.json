Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, which coats here would match my wardrobe the best?\nSystem: Starting on the round rack right in front of you, you can see a light grey coat.  Moving to the other round rack behind and to the right, there are a couple of black coats that would complement your wardrobe nicely.\nUser: Can I have the available sizes of the black one and the light grey one?\nSystem: Which black one was that?\nUser: The leftmost one please.\nSystem: Great, the black one comes in XS, M, L and XXL.  The light grey one comes in all sizes XS-XXL.\nUser: Do you have anything similar to the brown coat between the two black ones or maybe the grey coat at the far end of the counter?\nSystem: Sure, at the far end of the counter is another black coat.  The other black and light grey coats I already showed you are also pretty similar.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
