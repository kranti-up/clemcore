	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like find a jacket today! Can you help me, please?\\ \tt System: We have several grey ones available. What do you think of the light grey one on the back circular rack on the left? The rack in front of it also has a light grey one and a medium grey one.\\ \tt User: Do you have a blue one with a good rating, instead?\\ \tt System: On the left side of the store, there's a blue one on the wall. On the right side of the store, there are two blue ones on the circular rack.\\ \tt User: I'll go with the blue one on the left side and the blue one on the right rack that's sort of on the left side of that rack.\\ \tt System: Sure. I'll add both of those to your cart.\\ \tt User: I want to look for one similar to the light grey coat's size and brand. The one on the far right side of the wall.\\ \tt System: In addition to that one, there are light grey ones on the front left rack.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 77, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 26, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 82, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll go with the one on the back of the front rack.
