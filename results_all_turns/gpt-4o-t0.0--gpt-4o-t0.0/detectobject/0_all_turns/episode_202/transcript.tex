	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. Are there any XL T-shirts with half sleeves?\\ \tt System: I found a blue T-shirt hanging on the back left wall.\\ \tt User: Is there anything else with a good rating that doesn't cost that much?\\ \tt System: Not that I could find, sorry. Want to make another search?\\ \tt User: Is there any T-shirt?\\ \tt System: Only the blue one I showed you.\\ \tt User: Add the red and white blouse in the back left, as well as the beige dress in the back middle rack.\\ \tt System: Sure thing.\\ \tt User: Could you make sure it's by Yogi Fit and with a good rating?\\ \tt System: I couldn't find anything like that, sorry.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
