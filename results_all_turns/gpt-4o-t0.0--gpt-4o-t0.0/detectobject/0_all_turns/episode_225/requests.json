Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What decent trousers do you see, if any?\nSystem: Those grey ones on the far right would be a great buy!\nUser: That multicolored purplish short-sleeved top is so charming!

That top will be in your cart soon.\nUser: Oh I got a little carried away and forgot to ask for the size range and what brand makes it.\nSystem: Which item would you like to know those details on?\nUser: The multicolored short-sleeved top with the kind of floral-looking design.\nSystem: Cats Are Great is the brand that makes that top. Currently this top has small, large, and extra extra large in stock.\nUser: Can you tell me what distinguishes it from that biker-looking black studded tank on the left?\nSystem: The short-sleeved blouse in green, violet, and pink is an extra extra large and is also offered in small and large.
