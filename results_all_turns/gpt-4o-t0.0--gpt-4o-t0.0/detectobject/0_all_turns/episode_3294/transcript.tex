	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find some jackets?\\ \tt System: I have a red and white one jacket on the front rack, a light grey on the right wall, and a blue beside it. Do you like any of those?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the brand and ratings of the blue jacket and the light grey?\\ \tt System: Which jackets do you mean?\\ \tt User: The blue jacket on the right wall and the light grey beside it.\\ \tt System: The blue is from Home Store and has a 2.8 rating. The light grey is from 212 Local and has a 2.6 rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 8, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 0, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 37, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with the same color as the blue hoodie, but from Home Store and in XS?
