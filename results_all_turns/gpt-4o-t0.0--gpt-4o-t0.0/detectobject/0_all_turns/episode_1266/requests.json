Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What jackets  do you think I would like?\nSystem: I have two jackets in your style, both on the wall on the right: the brown one in the top row and the black one in the bottom row.\nUser: Could you tell me how differ ?\nSystem: Sure! The black jacket is by 212 Local. It is rated 4.1 and costs 169.99.  The brown one is by Coats & More. It has a rating of 3.5 and costs 199.99.\nUser: can you show me more jackets with positive customer reviews, like the black one?\nSystem: The brown jacket and the black one are the only similar jackets.\nUser: OK, can we focus on reasonable pricing and favorable customer reviews?\nSystem: I am sorry, I have no jackets that match both the  4.1 rating and the price range reasonable.\nUser: That's OK. I like those jackets, please put one brown one and one black one into my cart.\nSystem: Of course! You will see them in your cart in a moment.\nUser: I have another request: could you help me find a nice but inexpensive sweater from River Chateau?\nSystem: Unfortunately, my search for sweaters that match all these characteristics  has no results.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
