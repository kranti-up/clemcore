	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What are the good hoodies around here?\\ \tt System: I advise you consider that long-sleeved solid green one.\\ \tt User: I do like solid colors, but I'm looking for something with excellent ratings.\\ \tt System: In fact, that green hoodie is very highly rated.\\ \tt User: Actually, can I edit my search to be for something sleeveless? With excellent ratings of course.\\ \tt System: My apologies, but it appears there are no sleeveless plain hoodies with high ratings.\\ \tt User: Okay well just show me a hoodie you think would work well with the clothes I tend to wear on a daily basis.\\ \tt System: Did you have any interest in that green hoodie? I think you'd really like it!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 58, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Fine, you win. Put that green one in my cart.
