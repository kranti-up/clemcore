	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any good blouses you can show me?\\ \tt System: What about the black one in the second row of compartments, second from the left? In the next cubicle over you'll also see a black and white one that's available.\\ \tt User: Could you please add the first blouse you showed me to my cart?\\ \tt System: Yes, I'm doing that now.\\ \tt User: I'd also like a recommendation for well reviewed jackets in grey and white.\\ \tt System: What about the one in the second compartment in the second row, just to the left of the blouse you just purchased.\\ \tt User: Can you suggest anything else?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything. Would you like me to look for something else?\\ \tt User: What about something by Downtown Stylists?\\ \tt System: No, unfortunately, I couldn't find a match for a well reviewed jacket by Downtown Stylists in grey and white.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 53, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a hoodie in XXL in color brown.
