	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want some joggers with good reviews.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the dark green joggers?\\ \tt User: Anything else you can recommend?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but those are the only items which match your criteria.\\ \tt User: Can you recommend a jacket?\\ \tt System: Take a look at the grey jacket, the black jacket, or the red and white jacket.\\ \tt User: What is the difference between the red and white jacket on the far right and the red and white jacket immediately to its left?\\ \tt System: They both have a price of .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 28, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 29, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 69, joggers, dark green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Let's back up a bit. Add the dark green joggers to my cart.
