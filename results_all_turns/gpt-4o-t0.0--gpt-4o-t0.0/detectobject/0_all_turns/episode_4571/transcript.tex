	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi, do you have any blue hoodies?\\ \tt System: I do!  In the second compartment from the right of the shelves at the back left.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar to the light grey coat below the blue boxes or the grey coat on the round rack at the right end of the counter?  It needs to be affordable and have vertical stripes.\\ \tt System: Sorry, I can't find anything like that.\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets in XS?\\ \tt System: Sure, the grey jacket at the left end of the righthand shelving unit is XS.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 16, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 47, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 46, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 13, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you compare the sizes of the light grey coat at the back left and the grey coat on the round rack?
