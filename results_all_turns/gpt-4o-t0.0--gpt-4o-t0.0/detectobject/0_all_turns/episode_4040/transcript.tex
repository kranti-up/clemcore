	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a nice knit sweatshirt?\\ \tt System: Sure! Take a look at the pink one on the left.\\ \tt User: Thanks! Also, can you show me more dresses that cost about the same as the red one in the corner on the right and have a similar pattern?\\ \tt System: Certainly! Start with the brown dress in the same row as the red one but on the right, then move on to the floor rack further away from us and find the beige dress on the right and the olive one facing the entrance.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, dress, red, XL\\ \tt 28, dress, black, olive, S\\ \tt 30, dress, beige, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Thanks! What else here is highly rated?
