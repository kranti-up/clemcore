Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there, good morning!  I'm looking for some sweaters on the cheaper side.  Could you give me some suggestions?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the pink sweater in the third cubby from the front door?  It is in the cheap price range.\nUser: That's cute, I might come back to that.  What about the green blouse in that same cubby, and the white one in the far cubby?  Could you tell me what sizes those two are available in?\nSystem: Certainly.  The green blouse is available in sizes XS, S, and XL, while the white blouse is available in sizes S, L, and XXL.\nUser: Alright, let's go with the green one.  I also really like that grey blouse right in front of it in the next cubby over, could you put that in my cart as well?\nSystem: Certainly, I've added both items to your cart.\nUser: Could you check for something black for me now?  This time I would like to see what's on the expensive end.\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything that matches those criteria.\nUser: That's okay, I still have three more shops to hit.  Can you add those blue jeans under the pink sweater to my cart?\nSystem: Sure thing, I've added those jeans to your cart.\nUser: Can I look at some shirts now?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think of the brown and grey shirts on the far end of the table?  If those aren't colorful enough, the pink and white striped one towards the center of the table is also available.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
