	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a hoodie to match my clothes.\\ \tt System: Do you like this blue one hanging up on the right wall or the brown one on the center rack?\\ \tt User: I'd like something in a similar color as the brown one on the rack but with stripes and half sleeves.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?\\ \tt User: Let's put those black shoes in the back left cubby in my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok. I will add those now.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizes and brands of the grey jacket on the front right wall and the grey jacket on the center rack?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 17, shoes, black, XS\\ \tt 24, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 18, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The grey jacket on the bottom of the right wall in front and the grey jacket on the left side of the center rack.
