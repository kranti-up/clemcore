	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have some shelves that will go well with the rest of my furniture?\\ \tt System: What do you think about the two wooden shelves against the wall? There's one on the right and another on the left.\\ \tt User: Maybe, what are their price tags and materials?\\ \tt System: The right-hand shelves are wood and cost , and the left-hand shelves cost  and are also wood.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with natural fibers?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, there aren't any shelves with that material.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt 3, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt 0, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I think I'll actually go for that wooden coffee table in the back. Can you add that to my cart please?
