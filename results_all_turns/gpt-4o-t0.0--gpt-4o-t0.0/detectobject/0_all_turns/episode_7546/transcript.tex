	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want some denim pattern jeans.\\ \tt System: How about this dark blue denim paid on the right wardrobe?\\ \tt User: Could you add them to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure thing. I'll add those to the cart.\\ \tt User: What's the difference between the blue shoes in the beck of the right wardrobe and the blue shoes in front of those?\\ \tt System: They both blue Brain Puzzles shoes with a canvas pattern, available in M, L, and XXL, and displayed as size M. They are both priced at 179.99 and have a 2.9 rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 40, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 47, shoes, blue, M\\ \tt 48, shoes, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I want something similar to those shoes in terms of color and reviews.
