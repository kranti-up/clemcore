	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please show me a shirt.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the shirts on the table?\\ \tt User: Show me something from the same brand as the blue and black one or the brown one but in a velvet pattern.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no matches can be found. Do you need anything else?\\ \tt User: Yeah, add the grey shirt to my cart. The one in the back of the second row.\\ \tt System: Okay, it will be added.\\ \tt User: And also show me more shirts with a good review rating from customers.\\ \tt System: There are several, including a blue and black shirt, the brown shirt, and another grey shirt.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 15, shirt, blue, black, XS\\ \tt 23, shirt, brown, M\\ \tt 12, shirt, grey, XS\\ \tt 8, shirt, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add the grey shirt to my cart along with the blue and black shirt.
