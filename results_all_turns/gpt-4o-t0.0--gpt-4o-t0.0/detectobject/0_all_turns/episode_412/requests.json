Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me find a jacket that matches my wardrobe?\nSystem: Check out the black jacket hanging up on the top right against the wall and the brown one hanging up on the bottom left.\nUser: I think instead I'd like to get something like the pink sweater on the table, the one on the front row, second from the right, as well as the green one on the far right side of the back row. I'm looking for a similar brand but in the colors grey and brown.\nSystem: Unfortunately, nothing came up as a match for that.\nUser: Can you show me anything else?\nSystem: No, I couldn't find any sweaters in grey or brown that were by River Chateau.\nUser: Go ahead and show me some tee shirts instead.\nSystem: What do you think of the purple one hanging up against the wall, the center one on the bottom row, the violet one on the table, just to the left of the pink shirt, and the red one that's on the same row, the second one from the left.\nUser: I'll go ahead and buy the violet tee and the red one.\nSystem: I'm confirming that order and adding them to your cart.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
