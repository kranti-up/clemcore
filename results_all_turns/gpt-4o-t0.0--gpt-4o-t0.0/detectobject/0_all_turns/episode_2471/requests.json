Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs.

What sizes do those come in if I might ask?\nSystem: Those light grey coats are both available in the full range of sizes from extra small to extra extra large.\nUser: You know what, I really want something in dark blue by The Vegan Baker.\nSystem: I apologize, but I cannot find any dark blue shirts by that brand.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
