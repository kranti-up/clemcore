Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Guess I have to rely on ratings though, what are ratings of the grey one in the back and the grey one to the right?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which one did you want to know that for?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
