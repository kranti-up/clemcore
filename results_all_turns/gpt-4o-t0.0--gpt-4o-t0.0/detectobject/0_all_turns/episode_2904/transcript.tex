	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Your task is to find me a coffee table that other buyers are very keen on.\\ \tt System: Do either of the brown options intrigue you?\\ \tt User: Um, I'm looking for something white and extravagant.\\ \tt System: Oh, then I'm afraid there are no options for you to look at here.\\ \tt User: It's not the end of the world. Show me a sofa instead?\\ \tt System: I think you'll be quite taken with that grey one in the back!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt 1, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yeah, that fits the bill. Go ahead and ring me up for that, and oh, I guess I'll take the brown table on the left. I can always have it painted.
