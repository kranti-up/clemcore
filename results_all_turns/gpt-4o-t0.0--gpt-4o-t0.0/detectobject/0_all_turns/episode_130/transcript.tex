	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: COuld you show me a few pairs of jeans please?\\ \tt System: I've got the dark blue pair closest to you, the gray ones next to them, and another gray pair in the furthest cabinet.\\ \tt User: I'll take the dark blue pair, and the gray ones next to them.\\ \tt System: I'll update your cart.\\ \tt User: Have you got any tops in a white and gray combo?\\ \tt System: At the bottom left on the wall, I have that gray and white top.\\ \tt User: I'd like something in a similar size and brand as that, but in green, violet, and pink.\\ \tt System: I don't have any tops like that. Could I help you with something else?\\ \tt User: Okay, how about a top with sleeves like that one, but with a good rating?\\ \tt System: There's that gray and white top, the red plaid top above it, and the Christmas sweater in the second cabinet.\\ \tt User: Have you got any hoodies with a good rating I could see?\\ \tt System: On the left in the second cabinet from the door, I have that green hoodie.  Then at the front of the closer garment rack, I have the brown hoodie, and another brown hoodie to the left of it.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 37, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 76, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 11, blouse, white, grey, S\\ \tt 32, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me about the gray jeans in the third closest cabinet on the right, and the dark blue ones next to them?
