Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are there any good chairs here?\nSystem: There's one by the dining table in the back and two on the red rug to the front of that.\nUser: Are there any red ones from Uptown Gallery?\nSystem: Sorry, no, I don't see any like that.\nUser: I like Uptown Studio though. Do you have any of their area rugs?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n8, Chair, brown, NA\n3, EndTable, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok, I'll get that brown chair on the red rug.
