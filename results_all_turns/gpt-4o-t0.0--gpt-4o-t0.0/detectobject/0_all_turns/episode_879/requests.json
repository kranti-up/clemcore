Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Yo, I'm looking for brown tshirts. Spare no expense.\nSystem: Sorry, I didn't find anything. Can I help you with something else?\nUser: Hm, well I'll take that black coat. Top and to the left.\nSystem: Of course. Adding it now.\nUser: How does the blue jacket on the bottom row compare to the brown jacket on the top right on ratings? And what sizes do both of them come in?\nSystem: The blue jacket is only available in L with a 2.8 rating. The brown jacket is available in XL and M and holds a 3.5 rating.\nUser: Any blouses to show?\nSystem: What do you think of the tricolor blouse on the bottom row to the very right?\nUser: Yeah, I'll take that. And the brown tshirt above it.\nSystem: Of course, I'll add both now.\nUser: Do you have any blouses that have good ratings to show?\nSystem: How about the white and gray option to the right?\nUser: Anything similar in available sizes and from The Vegan Baker?\nSystem: I did not see any matches. How else can I help?\nUser: Any nice blouses with short sleeves in an affordable price range?\nSystem: Well, the good news is the blouse from earlier meets those qualities!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
