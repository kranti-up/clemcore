	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you find me a coat by StyleNow Feed in size XS?\\ \tt System: There is this grey coat in the top left of the wall unit, as well as another light grey option on the circular rack.\\ \tt User: Actually could I see a hoodie with long sleeves and good ratings?\\ \tt System: There is a green hoodie in the first section of the second wall unit, as well as a brown hoodie in the last section of the same unit, and another brown option on the circular rack.\\ \tt User: I think I'll purchase the light grey coat on the circular rack.\\ \tt System: Okay, I will save it to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 20, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 7, coat, black, L\\ \tt 14, coat, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Are there any other options I could see?
