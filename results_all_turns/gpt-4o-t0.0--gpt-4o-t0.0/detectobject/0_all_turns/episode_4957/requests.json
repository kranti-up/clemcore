Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs.

There's a black coat directly above the joggers and a grey one to the left of that.\nUser: Do you have anything more like the brown jacket on the front left?\nSystem: In addition to that brown jacket, I have a light grey jacket to the right of it.\nUser: Alright, going back to the coats, what are the display sizes of each and what other sizes are available?\nSystem: Which items are you referring to?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
