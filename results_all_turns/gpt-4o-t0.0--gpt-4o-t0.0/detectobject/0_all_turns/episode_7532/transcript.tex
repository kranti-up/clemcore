	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Got a jacket you can show me?\\ \tt System: Yes, there are multiple grey and white jackets  throughout the room, as well as a black jacket. What do you think of them?\\ \tt User: Add the black jacket and the grey and white jacket on the floor to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, both items will be added to your cart.\\ \tt User: Alright, now tell me the brand and the review rating of the grey and white jacket, please.\\ \tt System: Which jacket are you referring to? Please clarify.\\ \tt User: I am talking about the grey and white jacket on the floor.\\ \tt System: It is from Cats Are Great and has a rating of 4.9.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 35, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 15, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 8, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Okay, now tell me the difference between the green hoodie and the blue hoodie.
