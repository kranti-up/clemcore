	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like a holiday sweater please.\\ \tt System: Do you like the red and white one hanging on the front left rack?\\ \tt User: Let's go ahead and put it in my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok, I will add it to your cart now.\\ \tt User: I'd also like a sleeveless dress.\\ \tt System: How about the purple one up on the right wall, the brown and black one on the left back rack, or the grey one next to it? They are all sleeveless dresses.\\ \tt User: I'd like something with ratings like the brown and black one and that maroon one next to it, but with a more affordable price tag.\\ \tt System: I have the purple dress on the right wall, the grey dress on the back rack, and that same brown and black dress matching that description.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 24, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 16, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 20, dress, brown, black, L\\ \tt 10, dress, purple, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Let's put the brown and black dress in my cart along with the purple one.
