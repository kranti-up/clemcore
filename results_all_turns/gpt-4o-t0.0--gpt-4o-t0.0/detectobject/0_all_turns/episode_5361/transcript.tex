	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some hoodies for the cold weather coming up. Something with high customer ratings, please and thank you.\\ \tt System: One of these three might interest you. What do you think?\\ \tt User: I'm kinda liking that brown one in the middle row. The one further left. Anything similar?\\ \tt System: The other two you we were looking at share a lot of similarities.\\ \tt User: What's the size and brand of the green and brown ones?\\ \tt System: Sorry, could you be more specific?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 27, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I mean the green one we were looking at, and the brown one on the left I told you I liked.
