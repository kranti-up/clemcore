	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any pricier sweaters for me?\\ \tt System: I have the grey and black one on the table, the maroon one in front of it on the table, and the red and white one on the left rack.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the red and white sweater on the rack to the grey and black one on the table?\\ \tt System: The red and white one is a hanging long sleeved blouse. It is large and costs .99.  The grey and black one is a folder long sleeve blouse. It is extra large and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Go ahead and add the grey and black one to my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok. I will add it now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 30, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 25, sweater, grey, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me its rating and price?
