	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi, do you have any shirts?\\ \tt System: Sure, there are a few on the table.  In the back row are a couple grey and brown ones as well as a plain grey shirt.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the grey shirt with the grey and brown one beside the red shirt?\\ \tt System: Ok, the grey shirt costs .99 with a rating of 4.4, while the grey and brown one has a price tag of .99 with a 3.8 rating.\\ \tt User: Can I get the reviews?\\ \tt System: For which item?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 25, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 27, shirt, grey, XS\\ \tt 29, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 30, shirt, dark pink, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The other grey and brown one please.
