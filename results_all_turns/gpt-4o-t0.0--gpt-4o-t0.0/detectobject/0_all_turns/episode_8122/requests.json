Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Find jackets in size small.\nSystem: These are the results I found: a grey and white one on the front left of the room, a light grey one on the lower rack in the middle of the wall, and a blue one directly above it. Are you interested in any of those?\nUser: I like the customer review rating and size of that blue one. Any others like it?\nSystem: The similar items are the light blue and green one on the front shelf, the grey one at the end of the top wall pole, and the light grey one under the blue jacket.\nUser: Which do you think is the best choice for me if I want it to match what I already own?\nSystem: I'd suggest either the grey one in the back, the light blue and green one on the front display, or the brighter blue one at the front of the top hanging pole. What do you think?\nUser: I'll go with the one on the front shelf and the blue one in the middle of the wall hanger.\nSystem: Okay.
