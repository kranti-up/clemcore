Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Good evening! Had a crazy thought before bed, why don't I add some color or coziness to my home by buying an area rug. Could you help me find a perfect one please? I would like to rely on high ratings if I can.\nSystem: Of course, I can help with that! How do you like the red one in the back or the white one with the diamond design here in the front? Both of those have high ratings.\nUser: Perfect, you've read my mind. I have a colorful bedroom where the red one would look amazing in and my living room is all about contrast so that diamond design couldn't be a better fit. Could you add both to my cart?\nSystem: Sure, I will add both of those to your cart now.\nUser: Actually, do you have any other ones like the white one in price?\nSystem: Unfortunately, we just have that one and the red one from earlier.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, AreaRug, red, NA\n4, AreaRug, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ah, ok. No worries, I'll just take another red one then. I have a lot of open space I want to cover in my home."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-9Pfii55W0XXt0zbsVxPsmyKKYoPiV", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n1", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1715905600, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_729ea513f7", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 4, "prompt_tokens": 448, "total_tokens": 452}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 00:26:40.517588", "call_duration": "0:00:00.483940", "response": "ObjectID\n1", "model_name": "gpt-4o"}}}]
