	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some tees that I can mix and match with a lot of my other clothes please.\\ \tt System: I've got the blue one hanging at the bottom right on the left wall.\\ \tt User: Have you got any others you can show me?\\ \tt System: No, it doesn't look like I do.  Anything else I could show you?\\ \tt User: How about a blouse that would work with most of my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: On the garment rack in the front, I've got the white and black one at the middle left, the red white and yellow one at the back left, and the black one at the back right.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, tshirt, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the price and what sizes are in stock?
