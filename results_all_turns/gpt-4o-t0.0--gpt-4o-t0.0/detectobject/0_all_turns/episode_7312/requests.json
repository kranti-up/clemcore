Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Maybe something with words?\nSystem: Sure! How do you feel about the grey one on the left side of the table or the other grey one farther to the right?\nUser: Hmm, they look pretty similar, could you tell me how they are reviewed and their sizes?\nSystem: Yes, the left one is a size S and is has a 3.8 review. The one on the right is a size S and is reviewed at 3.8.\nUser: Ok, what a shame, they're too small. Can we look at trousers instead? Maybe like the grey one under the black coat or the other grey one to the left of those? Definitely has to be an XS.\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have anything similar to those.\nUser: Ok, no worries, I'll just take the grey ones on the left and see if I get lucky and they're an XS.\nSystem: Great, I will add those to your cart now.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
