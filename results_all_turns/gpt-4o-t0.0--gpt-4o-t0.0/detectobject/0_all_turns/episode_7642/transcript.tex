	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am looking for some plain coats.\\ \tt System: Have a look at these.\\ \tt User: Can you give me the customer reviews on the grey coat?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt User: I mean this grey coat.\\ \tt System: The customer review on this coat is 2.7.\\ \tt User: How do the grey pants compare to the blue ones?\\ \tt System: The blue pants cost 239.99 and have a customer review of 3.4.  They come in xxl. The grey ones are priced at 244.99 and come in xs. The average rating is 3.5.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 39, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 23, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 30, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 8, coat, black, L\\ \tt 11, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: They won't fit me! Please add the black coat and the black jacket to my cart.
