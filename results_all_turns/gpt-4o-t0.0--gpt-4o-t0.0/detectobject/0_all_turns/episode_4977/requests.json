Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello! Looking for a tshirt today to wear to a lunch date later, could really use your help today.\nSystem: I would be happy to help! What do you think about the blue and grey striped one, the orange and purple one to its left or the maroon one hanging in front of the window?\nUser: Do you have something similar the blue and grey one or the purple and orange one?\nSystem: Besides those two striped ones, we have the violet one to the right. What do you think?\nUser: I'm not sure. Now that I think of it, they all seem like they would be a pain to match with my other clothing! How about jeans that you could suggest?\nSystem: Yes, we have the blue and black ones all the way to the left and the dark blue ones right next to those. Let me know if any of those interest you!\nUser: Not really, no, but I like that green hoodie in the middle of the rack. Could you add that to my cart? I think it could really bring out the color of my eyes.\nSystem: Definitely, I will add that now!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
