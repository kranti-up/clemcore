	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Is there a jacket which you can recommend that has full length sleeves?\\ \tt System: Take a look at the jackets on the wall and let me know what you think of them.\\ \tt User: Tell me the differences in brand and pricing between the grey and white jacket and the light grey jacket.\\ \tt System: The grey and white jacket is from Cats Are Great and costs .99 and the light grey jacket is from 212 Local and costs .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 10, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Shw me something in the same size as those two but with  full length sleeves and brand.
