	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a dress but I don't know what I want.\\ \tt System: Do you like any of these?\\ \tt User: Sort of. What are the ratings and available sizes for the purple and grey ones?\\ \tt System: Could you be a little more specific? Which ones are you interested in?\\ \tt User: The light purple on the bottom left and dark grey bottom right.\\ \tt System: The purple one is rated a 3.6 and is available in all sizes except S. The grey is rated a 4.3 and comes in all sizes.\\ \tt User: What about price? And the available sizes?\\ \tt System: The purple is available in all sizes except small and is listed at .99. The grey comes in all sizes and is tagged at .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, dress, purple, XL\\ \tt 5, dress, grey, XXL\\ \tt 2, blouse, red, white, yellow, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Oh duh, you just said that. My bad. Those are too expensive for me though. I'll just get the crazy striped shirt up in the top left corner. Please and thank you.
