	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a new hoodie. Have anything in brown?\\ \tt System: How do you feel about the brown hoodie on the wall?\\ \tt User: Do you have something like that but with stellar reviews?\\ \tt System: I found two well rated hoodies, the brown one on the wall and the green one on the wall in the back.\\ \tt User: Oh cool, I like the green. Do you have anything with that olive color by Modern Arts?\\ \tt System: My search comes up empty.\\ \tt User: I'll just get those brown pants and the light grey coat above the blue jeans.\\ \tt System: Okay, I will add the pants and coat in your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 22, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 16, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in a small with vertical stripes?
