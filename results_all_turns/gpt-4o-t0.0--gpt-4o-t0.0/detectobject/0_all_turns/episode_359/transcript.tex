	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which t shirt goes best with my style?\\ \tt System: How about this purple tshirt on the bottom middle of the wall display on the left?\\ \tt User: Could you find me something with long sleeves and that is plain?\\ \tt System: How about this violet shirt on the bottom left on the table display>\\ \tt User: I'll take one of that shirt and also the purple tshirt.\\ \tt System: Okay, I will add both of those to your cart.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything that is also grey and white?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I do not.
