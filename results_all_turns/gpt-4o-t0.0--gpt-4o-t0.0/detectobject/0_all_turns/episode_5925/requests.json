Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

I'm on the hunt for something casual, but if I find something nice looking for work that'd be alright too.\nSystem: What do you think of the red shoes in the leftmost shelf of the center display?  The black ones in the third bottom cubby from the right against the wall would also work well for any occasion.\nUser: Actually, some other stuff is already jumping out at me.  Add that blue jacket on the far right rack to my cart, and also the light grey jacket in the fourth cubby from the left up against the wall.\nSystem: Certainly, I've added both items to your cart.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
