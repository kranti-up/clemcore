	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need an affordable shirt.\\ \tt System: I have affordable shirts. I have the dark pink and white striped one on the front row of the table, the grey brown one behind it to the left, and the grey brown one behind it to the right.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 29, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 25, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 30, shirt, dark pink, white, S\\ \tt 51, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 52, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 54, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me who makes the two grey brown ones and what sizes they are?
