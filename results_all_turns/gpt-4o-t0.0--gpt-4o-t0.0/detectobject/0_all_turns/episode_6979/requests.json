Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you point out an armchair that will look good with the wardrobe in   my bedroom?\nSystem: I can suggest three armchairs. First, the white one on our immediate left. Second, the grey one at the far end of the next display in front of us. Finally, the gray chair a little away from us on the right.\nUser: Thank you! Could you also tell me the customer ratings of two end tables here, the white one and the black one in the furthest display on the left?\nSystem: I am not sure which end tables you are looking at, could you rephrase?\nUser: Sure. I am looking at the furthest display in this room on the left. There are two end tables there, on the left side, one is black, the other is white.\nSystem: Thank you! I have this information for you: the black end table  from North Lodge is rated 3.7;  the white end table from StyleNow Feed enjoys a much higher rating, 4.9.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
