Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me some jeans?\nSystem: What do you think of the jeans to the left?\nUser: Hm, actually, is there anything like the black and white blouse above them, but with affordable prices and with a twin colored pattern?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I didn't get any hits.\nUser: Ok, well, who makes the blue jeans?\nSystem: Which pair?\nUser: The one you showed me earlier.\nSystem: It's from Yogi Fit.\nUser: Eh. Any blouses to show?\nSystem: Well aside from the one you pointed out, maybe you would like the black blouse to the left of it in the next slot?\nUser: Actually yes. I'll take the second one.\nSystem: You got it. I'll add that black blouse now.\nUser: Do you have any good coats to show?\nSystem: Well, what do you think of the the coats on the top left and bottom right of the set against the left wall? Or maybe you'd like the brown coat on the rack in front to the left?\nUser: Well, I'd like something like the top left of the set against the wall or the brown coat on the rack.\nSystem: The three items shown are the closest to your criteria to show.\nUser: I see. How do the two I specifically asked about compare on price and brand?\nSystem: The one against the wall is from StyleNow Feed and costs .99.
