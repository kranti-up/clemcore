	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Let's look at some t-shirts.\\ \tt System: Do you like the violet one on the table to the left?\\ \tt User: Can you compare the black sweater hanging on the wall with the green sweater on the table for me?\\ \tt System: The one on the wall is black and the one on the table is green.\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?\\ \tt System: I don't have any other t-shirts for you right now, I'm sorry.\\ \tt User: Can you show me shirts from North Lodge?\\ \tt System: I can help show you something like that. I have the white and grey one on the table to the left.\\ \tt User: Can you put the brown shirt next to it in my cart for me?\\ \tt System: Ok. I will add it it to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 48, sweater, green, S\\ \tt 53, shirt, brown, M\\ \tt 52, shirt, white, grey, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to see some dresses.
