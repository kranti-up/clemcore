Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are any of these sweaters good buys in your opinion?\nSystem: There are some great sweaters on the top row of that table to the left. How do you like the maroon one on the near end, the grey one next to it, and the red one further down?\nUser: Wait I love that black dress! What kinds of things are other people saying about it online, and what size is it?\nSystem: Could you identify more precisely which dress has caught your eye?\nUser: Yeah sure it's the black one on the left-hand side of this rack right up front and center.\nSystem: That dress is a large and has on average been rated a 4.5 by other buyers.\nUser: What other options can I look at?\nSystem: I advise you to also consider the red sweater on the lower row of that table, the maroon one next to it, and the other maroon sweater next to the other red sweater up top.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
