	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any quality jeans?\\ \tt System: How do you like the light blue jeans beneath the purple tanktop, the grey jeans to the right of those light blue jeans, and the the light blue jeans to the right of those?\\ \tt User: Can you compare the light blue jeans on the left and the light blue jeans on the right in regards to their reviews?\\ \tt System: Both pairs are 3.7.\\ \tt User: Have anything similar to those two in color and available size?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but it doesn't look like we have anything like that.\\ \tt User: Can you recommend a coat?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey coat next to the green tshirt, the grey coat to the right of that, and the grey coat just to the left of the red and white coat?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt 13, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: How about adding the light blue jeans on the right to my cart.
