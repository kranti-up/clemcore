	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some jeans?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the jeans to the left?\\ \tt User: Hm, actually, is there anything like the black and white blouse above them, but with affordable prices and with a twin colored pattern?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I didn't get any hits.\\ \tt User: Ok, well, who makes the blue jeans?\\ \tt System: Which pair?\\ \tt User: The one you showed me earlier.\\ \tt System: It's from Yogi Fit.\\ \tt User: Eh. Any blouses to show?\\ \tt System: Well aside from the one you pointed out, maybe you would like the black blouse to the left of it in the next slot?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 54, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt 55, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 53, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 23, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 50, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually yes. I'll take the second one.
