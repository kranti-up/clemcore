	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like a plain coat please.\\ \tt System: How about this black one up front next to the spotted blouse?\\ \tt User: Oooh this second black blouse is so cute! And that purple one hanging up top in the back is really nice. Tell me whatever you can about those to help me narrow it down.\\ \tt System: The black blouse is made of velvet and costs more, at .99. The purple blouse has a plain pattern and costs .99.\\ \tt User: I think that black one is a winner. I'll take that in my cart, and put that brown dress in my cart too while you're at it.\\ \tt System: I will happily put those items in your cart for you.\\ \tt User: I'd also be interested in looking at some coats, if you've got anything good.\\ \tt System: Did you want to look at that black coat next to the spotted blouse I showed you earlier?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 0, blouse, violet, XL\\ \tt 7, dress, dark brown, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Oh I forgot to tell you I really want something by the brand Cats Are Great.
