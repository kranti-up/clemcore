	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a jacket by Garden Retail. Do you have any here?\\ \tt System: I can show you two, both in brown. The first one is in the bottom row on the left; the other one is on the rack in front of us, on the left. Do you like them?\\ \tt User: OK, do you have jackets like the brown one on the wall but in leather?\\ \tt System: I can suggest both that brown jacket and the one on the rack.\\ \tt User: OK, I will buy the red, white, and yellow blouse at the right end of the bottom row on the wall. Please move it into my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure! It will be in your cart in a moment.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 8, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 2, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 10, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you also show me a nice hooded sweater?
