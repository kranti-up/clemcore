	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm trying to find an area rug.\\ \tt System: How about the white rug in the center of the room?\\ \tt User: Can you add that and the grey chair on the rug to my cart?\\ \tt System: No problem, I'll add those to your cart.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me about the materials of the two white lamps in the back of the room?\\ \tt System: Which ones do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, AreaRug, white, NA\\ \tt 3, CouchChair, grey, NA\\ \tt 0, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt 7, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: There two white lamps on the white rug toward the back of the room.
