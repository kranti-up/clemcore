	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please show me some jeans which go with the rest of my closet.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the dark blue jeans on the second row?\\ \tt User: Are there any other jeans which you recommend?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the dark blue jeans I mentioned earlier?\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes for the ones on the very right?\\ \tt System: Which items are you talking about?\\ \tt User: I mean the dark blue jeans on the very right.\\ \tt System: It is available in XL, S, XS, XXL, and M.\\ \tt User: Add both pairs of dark blue jeans to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, both pairs of dark blue jeans will be added to my cart.\\ \tt User: Add the ones on the very right to my cart again.\\ \tt System: Okay, they will be added to your car.\\ \tt User: Are there any other jeans you can show me?\\ \tt System: There is a pair of blue jeans on the right closet.\\ \tt User: Anything with short sleeves?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no matches were found.\\ \tt User: What is the price for the black dress?\\ \tt System: Please clarify which item you are talking about.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
