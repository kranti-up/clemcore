	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What jackets do you think look good?\\ \tt System: There's a grey jacket hanging under the blue shoe boxes on the right, a blue jacket hanging on the left side of the wall, and a grey and white jacket on the wall to the right. These are all ideas to consider.\\ \tt User: What about a nice tshirt sized medium with decent reviews.\\ \tt System: I found a green tshirt on the left wall, a blue shirt next to it, and another blue shirt next to that one on the wall.\\ \tt User: Tell me about the grey jacket under the blue boxes and the blue jacket on the left.\\ \tt System: The grey jacket is available in XS and priced at 174.99 and the blue jacket is available in L and priced at 99.99.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like the grey jacket on color and rating, but by Downtown Consignment and with a full sleeve?\\ \tt System: I don't see anything that fits that description.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 14, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What about something in XL?
