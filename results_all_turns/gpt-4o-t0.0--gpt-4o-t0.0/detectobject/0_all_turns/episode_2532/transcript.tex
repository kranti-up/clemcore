	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any dresses that are expensive and that have a plain pattern?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the violet dress, the maroon dress, and the black dress? They are all around the room.\\ \tt User: What do you have that has the same size as the violet dress and with spotted patterns.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no item matches your search criteria.\\ \tt User: Okay, now tell me how the maroon dress compares with the violet dress.\\ \tt System: The violet dress is sleeveless and is 244.99. The other is also sleeveless but is 184.99.\\ \tt User: Okay, narrow down the search to something expensive but with long sleeves.\\ \tt System: No item matches your search criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, dress, violet, XL\\ \tt 18, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Show me a grey jacket.
