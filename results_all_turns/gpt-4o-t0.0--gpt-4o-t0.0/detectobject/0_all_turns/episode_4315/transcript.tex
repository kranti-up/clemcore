	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a grey coat with an affordable price?\\ \tt System: There are several grey coats which match your search criteria. What do you think of them?\\ \tt User: Are there any trousers with plain patterns that you can show me?\\ \tt System: The brown trousers on the right match your criteria, as well as the blue trousers on the opposite side of the room. What is your opinion on them?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 35, shoes, red, L\\ \tt 37, shoes, blue, M\\ \tt 29, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 30, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What is the size and the review rating of the red shoes and the blue shoes?
