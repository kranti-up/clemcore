	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to find a pair of slacks please.\\ \tt System: How do you like the grey item towards the back and this pair to your left? These slacks might suit your needs.\\ \tt User: I'll take one of each.\\ \tt System: Great, I'm adding one of each of these to your cart.\\ \tt User: How much are they?\\ \tt System: Could you please specify which item you mean?\\ \tt User: I'm talking about the grey slacks to the left.\\ \tt System: These are 189.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 21, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else ?
