Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I want to get just one sweater today, so which sweater here would fit the rest of my wardrobe?\nSystem: You might like the black sweater on the right in the top row on the wall and another black sweater in the room on the left, a little bit round the corner.\nUser: I see it! I also need a blouse. Can you show me blouses like the red, white, and yellow one in the bottom row on the left, but from Pedals & Gears?\nSystem: I am sorry, I have no items that satisfy these requirements.\nUser: That's OK. Can you compare two black jackets for me, the one in the middle of the top row on the left and the one  on the wall hanger, towards the middle of the row on its left side?\nSystem: Of course!
