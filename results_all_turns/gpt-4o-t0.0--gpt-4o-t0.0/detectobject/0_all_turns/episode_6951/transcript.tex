	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you pull up a sofa chair?\\ \tt System: There are several grey sofa chairs you might like, along with a white sofa chair. Take a look at what I found.\\ \tt User: Add the two closest to the front to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, they will be added to your cart.\\ \tt User: Is there anything like the items you just added but with a good rating?\\ \tt System: Sorry, no other items match your description aside from the already mentioned ones.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, CouchChair, white, NA\\ \tt 9, CouchChair, grey, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: That's okay. Pull up a brown table from Modern Arts now.
