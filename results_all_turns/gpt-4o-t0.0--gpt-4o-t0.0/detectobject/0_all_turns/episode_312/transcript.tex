	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: How about coats?\\ \tt System: Do you like the black one rightmost cubby or the grey one two cubbies over?\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy the grey coat and the white and black blouse in the next cubby over as well.\\ \tt System: Ok, I will add those two items to your cart for you.\\ \tt User: Let's look just at options that come in medium.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have any medium coats for you right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 4, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 3, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 6, blouse, light grey, M\\ \tt 44, dress, purple, XL\\ \tt 43, dress, brown, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the pricing and sizing for the light grey sleeveless blouse in the second cubby from the left and the maroon and white blouse in the same cubby?
