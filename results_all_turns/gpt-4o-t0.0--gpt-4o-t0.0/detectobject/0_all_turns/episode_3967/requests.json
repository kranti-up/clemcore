Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like to buy some extra small jeans today.\nSystem: I can get you that size in the light denim pair in the bottom cubby of the shelf on the right, or if you prefer a dark wash, I've got an extra small in the jeans in those two right bottom cubbies of the shelf on the left.\nUser: I like the light pair and the dark wash pair on the left. Can you check and make sure they are available in my size?\nSystem: Yes, those jeans are both available in an extra small.\nUser: Okay, thanks for that. I'm also going to be wanting an inexpensive hat with excellent reviews.\nSystem: How do you feel about that white hat right in front or the two black hats on the right end of the shelf?\nUser: Is that all you've got?\nSystem: You might also be interested in that camo hat or the dark green one to the right of it.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
