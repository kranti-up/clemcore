Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like to find some wooden shelves, and I'd like to stick to my budget, so something in a mid-range price, please.\nSystem: I don't seem to have any shelves that fit your specifications.  Could I help you with anything else?\nUser: That brown chair between the two gray tables has a nice shape.  Do you have anything like it with natural fibers?  Something expensive!\nSystem: I don't have any chairs like that at the moment, you may want to check back when next season's items come in.\nUser: Well, back to shelves, which of them do you think would work best with my decor?  I like to color-coordinate.\nSystem: Well, wood is always a good choice to coordinate with.  I have the short wooden ones at the left side of the half wall, as well as the light-tone wood cabinet to the right with the drawer and doors.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n5, Chair, brown, NA\n0, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\n1, AreaRug, red, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh, I can't make up my mind today.  But I think I'll go with that red rug in the back, and that coffee table that's sitting on it.  Please put those in my cart."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-9PfixAV9D48gmPRw8RCqYmkX5rKHT", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n0\n1", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1715905615, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_729ea513f7", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 6, "prompt_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 467}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 00:26:54.795865", "call_duration": "0:00:00.497294", "response": "ObjectID\n0\n1", "model_name": "gpt-4o"}}}]
