	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you try to find me a long-sleeve jacket that's been applauded by other buyers?\\ \tt System: I think you'll love that brown one hanging at the back of that lower bunch of clothes against the wall!\\ \tt User: Wow I love this shirt on the table! What are they asking for it?\\ \tt System: Sorry, which shirt would you like to know the price of?\\ \tt User: That dirty yellow one next to the purple shirt. It's on the bottom shelf of that three-tiered stand.\\ \tt System: That shirt is priced at .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 27, tshirt, yellow, S\\ \tt 11, tshirt, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Wow there's no way I can afford that today. Can you show me something just like it that doesn't cost a fortune but still has good reviews?
