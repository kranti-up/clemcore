	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a vest that I can wear with a few different outfits.\\ \tt System: How about the white one on the hanging rack to your left?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me about the hoodies instead? The blue and green ones. What brand are they?\\ \tt System: The blue one is from Global Voyager. The other is from Downtown Consignment.\\ \tt User: I see. Do you have any other plain, maroon shirts like the one over on the wall, but in a M?\\ \tt System: That's the only one I have in that color.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 32, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 26, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 6, tshirt, maroon, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Show me a coat then.
