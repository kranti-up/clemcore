Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs.

I'm looking for a similar brand but in the colors grey and brown.\nSystem: Unfortunately, nothing came up as a match for that.\nUser: Can you show me anything else?\nSystem: No, I couldn't find any sweaters in grey or brown that were by River Chateau.\nUser: Go ahead and show me some tee shirts instead.\nSystem: What do you think of the purple one hanging up against the wall, the center one on the bottom row, the violet one on the table, just to the left of the pink shirt, and the red one that's on the same row, the second one from the left.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
