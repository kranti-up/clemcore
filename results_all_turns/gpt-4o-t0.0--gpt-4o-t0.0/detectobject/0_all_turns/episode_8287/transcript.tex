	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Is there an affordable shirt that you can recommend me?\\ \tt System: There are several on the table you might like, including a blue and black shirt, a grey shirt, and a brown shirt.\\ \tt User: What else is there that is like that brown shirt on the bottom row?\\ \tt System: There are several. Take a look at the first ones I recommended in addition to the brown shirt on the second row.\\ \tt User: I actually want a sweater in XL with good reviews. Anything to show me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the green sweater,s or the grey and black sweater? All on the table.\\ \tt User: Refine it again. Something affordable and in XXL.\\ \tt System: Nothing matches your criteria. What else can I do for you?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 22, shirt, brown, S\\ \tt 23, shirt, brown, M\\ \tt 18, sweater, grey, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add the brown shirt and the grey and black sweater to my cart.
