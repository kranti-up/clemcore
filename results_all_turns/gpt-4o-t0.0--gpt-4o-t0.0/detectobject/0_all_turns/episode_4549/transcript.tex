	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new dress, what do you have that's well-reviewed?\\ \tt System: I have a maroon dress and a black dress next to each other on the right of this front floor rack and an olive dress on the back of that floor rack. What do you think of those?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 7, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 39, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Not bad, but I'm not sure yet. Tell me more about the display size and reviews on that pink sweater and black sweater on the right wall.
