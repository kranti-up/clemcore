Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need to get new jeans.\nSystem: I can recommend two pairs on the left, at the wall: the light-blue pair  and the blue-black pair next to it.\nUser: Can we only look at jeans in XL?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I cannot find any jeans in that size.\nUser: That's OK.
