	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you recommend a checkered or plain dress from Pedals & Gears?\\ \tt System: I don't have any.\\ \tt User: Anything else you can show me?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything.\\ \tt User: Do you have the sizes for the brown and black dress and the black and gray one?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The ones hanging on the right wall.\\ \tt System: The brown and black one is a L and comes in XS, L, XL, and XXL.  The black and gray one is an XXL and comes in S, M, and XXL.\\ \tt User: I'll take both of those.\\ \tt System: Cool, I'll put them in your cart.\\ \tt User: Also add the violet dress and the white, red, and violet blouse to my cart.\\ \tt System: I'll do that right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
