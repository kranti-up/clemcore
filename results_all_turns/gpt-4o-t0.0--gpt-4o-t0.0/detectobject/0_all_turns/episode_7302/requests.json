Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm hoping to find a good shirt from Modern Arts.\nSystem: How about the orange and purple shirt up there?\nUser: Eek.

Not the one you mentioned, but the one on the other side.\nSystem: Got it.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
