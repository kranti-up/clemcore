Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Pardon me?  Do you have any joggers in dark green?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the dark green joggers in the second cubby from the right?\nUser: They're decent, maybe what I want first is coat though.  what do you have with a plain pattern?\nSystem: Take a look at the black coat hanging up on the far left rack, and the grey coat hanging up on the rack in the back right corner.  If those colors don't suit you, I can also offer the brown coat in the fifth cubby from the right.  Do any of those interest you?\nUser: Do you have anything else?\nSystem: Sure, other plain coats include the black coat in the fourth cubby from the left, the black coat in the fourth cubby from the right, and the black coat hanging up on the rack in the center of the room.
