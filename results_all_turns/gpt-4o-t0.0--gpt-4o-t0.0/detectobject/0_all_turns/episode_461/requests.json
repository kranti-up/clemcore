Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of the jackets in this room fits my style?\nSystem: I think the following three jackets are in your style: the light grey one on the floor hanger by the entrance, the black one near it, and another black one on the floor hanger in the middle of the room. Do you like any of them?\nUser: Can you show me more jackets in the same size as the black one on the rack near the entrance?\nSystem: I can suggest the light grey jacket on that rack,  the brown one  in the first cupboard from the right, in the second compartment from the right, and, of course, the black jacket on the rack by the entrance itself.\nUser: I see. Which one has a more reasonable price, the black one at by the entrance or the light grey one? And I also want to know who makes them.\nSystem: The black jacket from Yogi Fit costs 174.99. The light grey one, from 212Local, has a lower price, 44.99.\nUser: Ok, for the moment, please put that white, red, and violet blouse from the first cupboard on the right into my cart.\nSystem: Sure! I am adding it as we speak.\nUser: I will also take the black jacket by the entrance and the brown one in the first cupboard on the right.\nSystem: Of course! You will see them in your cart in a second.\nUser: Thanks! Can you also show me some nice sweaters?\nSystem: May I offer you the black sweater on the left  and another black one on the left side  of the floor rack closer to us?\nUser: Ok!
