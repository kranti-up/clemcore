	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any cheap vests?\\ \tt System: How is this blue and white option on the rack right in front of you?\\ \tt User: Do you have something similar to the light grey coat on the circular rack, or the light grey coat on the second section of the wall unit in color and review but with horizontal stripes?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything quite like that.\\ \tt User: What are the ratings on those trousers?\\ \tt System: Which trousers are you referring to?\\ \tt User: The brown trousers on the far right of the wall unit.\\ \tt System: Those are rated 3.6.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 3, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 17, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have any tshirts I could see?
