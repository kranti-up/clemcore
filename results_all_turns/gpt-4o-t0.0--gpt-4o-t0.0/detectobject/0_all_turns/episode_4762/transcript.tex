	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm really hoping you can help me find a top by Global Voyager.\\ \tt System: There's a fun top in maroon, white, and blue by that brand! It's hanging against the far wall next to that green shirt.\\ \tt User: Okay a dress is the last thing I need right now, but I'm a sucker for maroon. Can you get me the sizes of this maroon one hanging up front on the first rack and that other one on the left side of that rack to the left? And tell me what other sizes they're offered in.\\ \tt System: Both of the maroon dresses depicted in this representation are larges. They are both also offered in extra small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large.\\ \tt User: Okay I really need to restrain myself on the dresses. Please distract me with some bargain-rate tshirts in green.\\ \tt System: There is a solid green shirt hanging against the wall in the back that would meet your budget requirements!\\ \tt User: Ugh, my heart just really wants a dress. I'd like you to add that classy red number hanging up in front to my cart, and can you also get me this green hoodie on the right?\\ \tt System: Happy to be of assistance. I'll put that dress and that hoodie in your cart right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 10, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 21, dress, red, XL\\ \tt 22, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 3, blouse, green, white, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Hm and you know what I could really use that greenish-white blouse hanging in the window next to the purple checkered skirt. Throw that in the cart too.
