Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any hoodies to suggest?\nSystem: That blue one at the right end of that set of shelves in the back to the left is a great choice, as is the green hoodie hanging to the left of it. You also can't go wrong with the blue one hanging on the rack to the right of the shelf with the hats on top.\nUser: Well I just love the shade of those two blue hoodies, but I don't suppose you could get it for me in denim?\nSystem: I'm sorry, but there are no denim hoodies in that color.\nUser: Gotcha. Say, what's the label on that blue hoodie on the shelf and the green one next to it?\nSystem: That blue hoodie is made by Global Voyager, while Downtown Consignment is the brand that makes the green one.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
