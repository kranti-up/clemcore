	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm in the market for some blazers.\\ \tt System: I've got the blue one in the first cabinet, as well as the gray and white one hanging second from the right in the third cabinet.\\ \tt User: I'd also like to see what you could recommend in jeans?\\ \tt System: In the second cabinet and the fourth cabinet, I have two pairs of black-blue jeans you might be interested in.\\ \tt User: Do you have any pairs by Ocean Wears?\\ \tt System: No, I don't happen to have any jeans from Ocean Wears.\\ \tt User: In the third cabinet, could you tell me about that black blazer second from the left, and the gray one at the far right?\\ \tt System: The black one is a L, comes in XS, M, L, XL, and XXL.  It has full sleeves, a 4.5 rating and is made by North Lodge.  The gray one is an XL, available in all sizes XS-XXL, has long sleeves, a 3.8 rating and is from StyleNow Feed.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 7, coat, black, L\\ \tt 3, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 11, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy that gray and white blazer you showed me in the third cabinet, as well as the blue jeans in the cabinet right below that blazer.  Please add them to my cart.
