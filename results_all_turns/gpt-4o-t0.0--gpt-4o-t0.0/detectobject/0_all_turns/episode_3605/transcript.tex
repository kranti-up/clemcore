	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a blouse with good ratings.\\ \tt System: I can help you find that. I have the white and red one hanging in the cubby on the far right, the pink and white one on the front rack, and the black one on the same rack.\\ \tt User: I'd like something with a similar rating and sleeve length as the white and red one in the top right cubby but in an extra large.\\ \tt System: I have that one in the top cubby, the maroon and blue one in the front left cubby, and the black one in the cubby behind it.\\ \tt User: Let's put the black one in my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok, I will add it now.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizes and ratings of the green hoodie on the center rack and the blue hoodie in the top left cubby?\\ \tt System: The one on the rack is rated 2.8 and is available in small, medium, and large. The one in the cubby is rated 3.4 and is available only in small.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, blouse, white, black, red, XL\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 10, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 3, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like a jacket with a plain pattern.
