	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a very inexpensive shirt in XXL.\\ \tt System: Check out the black one that sits first on the table to the right.\\ \tt User: Cool, what company makes it, and is is highly rated?\\ \tt System: I am sorry, could you clarify which item you mean?\\ \tt User: I mean the black shirt first from us on the table to the right.\\ \tt System: Thanks! This shirt is by HairDo, and is currently rated 2.5.\\ \tt User: Hmm, could you show me a nice long-sleeve jacket in black?\\ \tt System: I can recommend the black jacket on the far end of the top row on the right and the one that is second to last in the bottom row there.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 8, tshirt, black, XXL\\ \tt 0, coat, black, L\\ \tt 11, coat, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: OK, which one is cheaper?
