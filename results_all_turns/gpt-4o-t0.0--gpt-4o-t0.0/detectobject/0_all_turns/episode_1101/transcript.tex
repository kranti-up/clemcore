	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets?\\ \tt System: I have the third and fifth ones on the top left wall and the fifth one on the bottom of the wall. Do you have any opinion of them?\\ \tt User: What's the difference between the brown one on top and the black one on the bottom?\\ \tt System: The top one comes in XL and M, the bottom one in S.\\ \tt User: Let me get that first blouse on top of the wall.\\ \tt System: I'll get that in your cart for you.\\ \tt User: What else have you got?\\ \tt System: I have this one all the way on the back wall, top left.\\ \tt User: I'll have that one, too.\\ \tt System: I'll make sure it's in your cart as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 46, jacket, black, S\\ \tt 40, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 0, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt 68, sweater, dark grey, XL\\ \tt 61, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 50, shirt, blue, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do have any shirts with vertical stripes?
