	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me an expensive hoodie, please.\\ \tt System: There is a blue hoodie and a green hoodie. What do you think of those?\\ \tt User: Which of those blouses you have will go with my closet?\\ \tt System: There is a pink and white blouse, a black blouse, and a maroon, white, and blue blouse that match your closet.\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: There is a black blouse and a white, black, and red blouse on your left closet.\\ \tt User: What are the brand and customer review differences between the black blouse and the white, black, and red blouse?\\ \tt System: The black blouse has a rating of 3.7 and is from StyleNow Feed. The white, black, and red blouse has a rating of 4.5 and is from North Lodge.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 1, blouse, white, black, red, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add the black blouse to my cart, please.
