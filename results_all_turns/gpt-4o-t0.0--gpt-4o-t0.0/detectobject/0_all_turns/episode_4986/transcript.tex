	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: In your expert opinion, would one of the jackets here go particularly well with the clothes I routinely wear?\\ \tt System: I think you might be enamored with this grey jacket up front to the right, the red and white jacket at the left end of that rack in the middle of the floor, or the black option at the right end of the bottom row in the back near the windows.\\ \tt User: Wait I'm sorry. I think I meant a coat.\\ \tt System: In that case, turn your attention to the black coat hanging above the striped shirts in the back, the other black coat on the other side of that green sweater, and the brown coat to the left of those past the brown shirt.\\ \tt User: Wait, I changed my mind again. I want something along the lines of that green hoodie up front near the red and white jacket from before.\\ \tt System: If that hoodie caught your eye, perhaps you'd like to consider the green hoodie hanging on the top row in the very back or the blue hoodie at the front of that rack the other green hoodie is at.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 26, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 32, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I could be down for that blue hoodie actually. What's the brand of that and the green one?
