Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd love some jeans recs, especially if there's something highly rated around here.\nSystem: Those three pairs of jeans to the left all have good reviews!\nUser: Well great! Can I get you to add those to my cart?\nSystem: You bet! Those jeans will be in your cart shortly.\nUser: Those hoodies are tempting me too. I like that brown one to the far left and the blue one in the same section. Is there anything you can tell me to help me make a confident decision between them?\nSystem: The blue hoodie is cheaper than the brown one. It costs .99, while the brown hoodie costs .99.\nUser: Actually, I just got paid, and I want to treat myself to something extravagant. Show me a fancy hoodie with the same sleevelength and by the same brand as those two.\nSystem: I wish I could, but unfortunately there are no expensive hoodies similar to those ones.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
