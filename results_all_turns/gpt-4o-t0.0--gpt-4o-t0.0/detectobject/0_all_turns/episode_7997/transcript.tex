	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Looking for a hoodie, can you help me out?\\ \tt System: I found a blue hoodie at the front left of the rack, a green hoodie in the very back under the bright blue one, and a brown hoodie right on the front left.\\ \tt User: How about some with good reviews?\\ \tt System: The green hoodie to the right of the original one, as well as the blue one right behind the blue one I first mentioned, fit that description.\\ \tt User: Compare the price on those two.\\ \tt System: The green hoodie costs .99, and the blue hoodie costs .99.\\ \tt User: Add the green one to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, I'll add the green hoodie to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 19, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 35, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 16, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Actually, also add the second blue one and the original green one.
