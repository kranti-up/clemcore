	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which hoodie would blend in with my style?\\ \tt System: We have two on the wall rack on the left, the first one on the top and the last one on the bottom. We also have a green one towards the left of the cubicles in the center row\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the price for the green one and the brown one? And who makes them?\\ \tt System: The green one is from Downtown Consignment and retails for .99. The other is from 212 Local and sells for .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 0, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 48, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 8, jacket, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have something like those in size L with good ratings?
