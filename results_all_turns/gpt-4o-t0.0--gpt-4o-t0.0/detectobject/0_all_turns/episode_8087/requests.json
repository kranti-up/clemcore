Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new tee, can you pick some out to match the rest of my closet?\nSystem: Yes, I can help with that. I found three on this table display you might like. There's a red tee in the center of the top shelf, a green tee underneath that, and a yellow tee on the bottom shelf on the lower left.\nUser: That green one isn't bad. Do you have anything with the same sizes as it, but sleeveless and more affordable?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I don't have anything currently available that fits that description.\nUser: Alright, that's fine. What about a short-sleeve from Uptown Gallery?\nSystem: Unfortunately I don't have anything by that description either. Can I help with something else?\nUser: Yes, can you compare the purple shirt that's on the bottom shelf next to the yellow shirt to the olive and white one that's near the green shirt?\nSystem: Of course! The purple shirt, displayed in size S, is .99 and the olive and white shirt, also displayed in size S, costs .99.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
