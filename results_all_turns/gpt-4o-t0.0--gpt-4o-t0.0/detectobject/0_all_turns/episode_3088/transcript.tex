	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm in the market for a nice coffee table, what can you show me?\\ \tt System: Ok, take a look at these. I have two wooden coffee tables, on on the left and another further back on the right.\\ \tt User: Who makes them, and what're they gonna cost me?\\ \tt System: Which do you mean?\\ \tt User: The two wooden coffee tables you pointed out.\\ \tt System: Both coffee tables cost  and are by Art Den.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt 6, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok. Do you have any cheap white armchairs?
