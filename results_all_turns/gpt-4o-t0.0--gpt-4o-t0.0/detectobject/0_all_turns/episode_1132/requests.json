Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Yo, what dresses ya got?\nSystem: I have three that might interest you. The maroon dress on the rack to the left, the red dress on the middle rack, and the beige dress on that same rack. What do you think?\nUser: Got anything else to show that's sleeveless?\nSystem: Sure, the black and olive dress on the middle rack, next to the beige dress, could work.
