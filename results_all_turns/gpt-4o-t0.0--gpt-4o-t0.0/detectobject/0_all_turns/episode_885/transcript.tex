	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any blouses I can see?\\ \tt System: I have a maroon, white, and blue hanging on the back wall and a black one below it.\\ \tt User: I'll take both, please.\\ \tt System: No problem, both have been added to your cart.\\ \tt User: Do yo have anything with a similar pattern and available sizes as the grey and black sweater and the green from the table, but in maroon, white, and blue and with good reviews?\\ \tt System: I have nothing matching that description.\\ \tt User: What are the ratings and brand of the green sweater?\\ \tt System: Which sweater?\\ \tt User: The green one on the table in front.\\ \tt System: That is from Coats & More and has a 3.6 rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 78, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 60, sweater, grey, black, XL\\ \tt 48, sweater, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'll take that too.
