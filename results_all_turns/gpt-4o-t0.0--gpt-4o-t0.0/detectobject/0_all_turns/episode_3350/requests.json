Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello, I need a jacket to match the rest of my attire.\nSystem: Sure!

There's also a light grey jacket to the left of that.\nUser: Can I have the brand and reviews for the black coats please?\nSystem: Which black coats do you mean?\nUser: One is to the left of the light grey jacket at the back, and the other is on the back side of the round rack.\nSystem: The one at the back is from Cats Are Great and has a very high rating of 4.8.  The one on the rack is from Pedals & Gears and rated at 3.0.\nUser: Do you have anything similar to the one at the back of the room in terms of pattern and price?\nSystem: Sure, well for starters the black one on the rack is pretty similar.
