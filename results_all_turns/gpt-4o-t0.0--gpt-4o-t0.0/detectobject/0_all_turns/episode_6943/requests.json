Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Can you tell me what they're made with?\nSystem: Both of those pieces are made with leather.\nUser: Oh wait I found it! That grey chair on the grey rug over there is just divine. If you would be so good as to add it to my cart I'd be mighty thankful! And throw that white lamp on the ground by the green lamp in while you're at it.\nSystem: You got it!
