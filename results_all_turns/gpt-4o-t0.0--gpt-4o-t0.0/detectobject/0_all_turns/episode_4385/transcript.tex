	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you think you could help me find some spotted shoes in extra small?\\ \tt System: There are some spotted grey ones in that size on the bottom shelf to the far left!\\ \tt User: Wow, you're like magic! Please add those to my cart, fairy robot godmother.\\ \tt System: I'm so happy to help. I'll get those shoes in your cart right away.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 22, shoes, grey, XL\\ \tt 7, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 14, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 9, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 2, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I could also use a new hoodie. Could you check and see if you've got something in the same vein as that light brown one in the second compartment on the shelf to the left or the blue one on the right next to the purple houndstooth skirt, but in dark blue and by the brand New Fashion?
