	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to look for a long-sleeve hoodie.\\ \tt System: That blue hoodie on the bottom row right up front and the brown one next to it both have long sleeves. Do you like what you see?\\ \tt User: Wait a minute, what sizes do you have of that grey jacket on the left end of that first table back there and the denim one in the back right?\\ \tt System: I can get you both of those in the full range of sizes from extra small to extra extra large.\\ \tt User: What can you show me by the same brand as that denim jacket with better reviews?\\ \tt System: You may want to take a look at the denim jacket on the left side of that same row.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt 11, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Oh by the way it needs to be by Global Voyager, and I really don't have much spending money right now.
