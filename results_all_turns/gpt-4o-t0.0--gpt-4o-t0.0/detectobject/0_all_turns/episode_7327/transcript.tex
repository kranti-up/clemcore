	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey there. Are there any trousers I would like?\\ \tt System: Tell me what you think of the grey trousers in the second and fourth cubbies from the left.\\ \tt User: I need something in M.\\ \tt System: Then you might like the third pair and fifth pair from the left. Both are in M.\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes and price of the third pair?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt User: The jeans in the third cubby from the very left.\\ \tt System: It costs .99 and comes in XS, M, L, XL, and XXL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you make sure it has a good rating.
