	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any good jackets?\\ \tt System: The blue jacket on the left rack, the grey jacket on the side of the rack, and the grey and white jacket on the top row along the wall fit your criteria. What do you think of them?\\ \tt User: Add the blue jacket on the wall and the black coat to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, both items will be added to your cart.\\ \tt User: How do they compare on size and brand? The blue jackets, I mean.\\ \tt System: They are both in S and are from Global Voyager.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 7, coat, black, L\\ \tt 11, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 12, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What is the brand of the grey and white jacket?
