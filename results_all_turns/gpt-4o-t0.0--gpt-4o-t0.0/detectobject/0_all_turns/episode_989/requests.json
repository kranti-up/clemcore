Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me some coats?\nSystem: I have this first one by the windows and the one next to the multi colored one up top on the wall.\nUser: Can you tell me the brand and size of the second one?\nSystem: Which one did you mean?\nUser: The coat on the wall.\nSystem: That's shown in XL, from Pedals and Gears.\nUser: Let me get the brown jacket right in front of the green hoodie on the second floor stand.\nSystem: I'll put that in your cart.\nUser: How about a solid color hoodie?\nSystem: I have this one right behind the jacket you just bought.\nUser: How about a dress with good ratings?\nSystem: I have these two on the left and the maroon  one in the middle of three dresses next to them.\nUser: Which tee shirt would go best with my ensemble?\nSystem: How about the one in the front right corner?\nUser: I like the second one in the row on the right of the middle shelf and the second one on the back row of the bottom shelf.
