	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some trousers\\ \tt System: Here are these two pairs?\\ \tt User: Can you find me a hoodie?\\ \tt System: Here are these three options.\\ \tt User: Can you add this black coat to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure thing.\\ \tt User: How different are the prices of those two coats?\\ \tt System: The grey coat costs 59.99 and the light grey one costs 179.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 66, coat, black, L\\ \tt 13, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 17, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 30, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you add the grey coat and the brown trousers to my cart?
