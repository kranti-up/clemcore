	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am looking for some blouses.\\ \tt System: Sure, I can help find blouses. Have a look at this black, white one here in the front of the right wall, the red, white one about it, and this red, white one on the top shelf of the black wall.\\ \tt User: Could you add the red, white one on the back wall and the black, white one to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure, I added those items to your cart for you.\\ \tt User: Do you have the available sizes of the red, white blouse?\\ \tt System: Which blouse are you referring to?\\ \tt User: I mean the one on the back wall.\\ \tt System: It is available in S, XS, L, and XL, and displayed as size L.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt 26, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Anything similar to the red, white blouse on the back wall and the black, white one but from Uptown Gallery?
