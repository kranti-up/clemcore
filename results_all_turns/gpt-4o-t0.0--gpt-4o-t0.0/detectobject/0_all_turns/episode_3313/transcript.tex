	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi!  Could you give me some suggestions on coats?  It's always hard for me to decide on one but it's getting really cold out!\\ \tt System: Certainly, how do you like the black and grey coats hanging up on the rack nearest to you?  If you prefer the black one, there's also another black coat in the far cubby on the right you may want to take a look at.\\ \tt User: Maybe something more casual like a hoodie would be better.  What brand is that brown hoodie on the rack?  And what about the one in the second farthest cubby on the left?\\ \tt System: Both of those hoodies are made by the brand 212 Local.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 19, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 3, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else similar?  I do kinda like them both.
