	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm crossing my fingers you'll tell me you see a blue Global Voyager hoodie.\\ \tt System: That blue one in the back on the right end of those shelves on the left are made by that brand!\\ \tt User: Can I see some more choices with high ratings please?\\ \tt System: I apologize, but it looks like there are no highly rated blue hoodies by Global Voyager here.\\ \tt User: Oh rats. Well then I'll just take that yellow shirt on this rack up front to the right and that dark green hat on the left end of that shelf over there. It would be super cool if you could put those in my cart for me.\\ \tt System: I will happily add those items to your cart for you.\\ \tt User: Oh and before I wrap up here, what's that jacket rated, and what sizes could I buy it in?\\ \tt System: Which jacket are you inquiring about?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 85, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt 87, shirt, yellow, S\\ \tt 52, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: It's over there on the rack on the right end of that second display table of hats.
