	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any upscale trousers in these parts?\\ \tt System: The grey pants and the camo ones next to them are quite luxurious.\\ \tt User: I'd like something with the same ratings and colors as those, but I really have my heart set on something by HairDo.\\ \tt System: So sorry, but I can't find any similar items by that brand.\\ \tt User: Rats. Well just show me what you can find in extra small.\\ \tt System: The grey pants are available in that size!\\ \tt User: Okay cool and now can you see what comes up in medium?\\ \tt System: I regret to tell you that there are no options in medium. Can I help you find something else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt 7, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I guess I'll go ahead and buy a pair of those grey pants and a pair of the camo ones too.
