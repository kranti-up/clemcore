	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which blouse here would fit in with what I already have?\\ \tt System: I would like to show you three blouses. Going from right to left, look at the maroon, white, and blue one, the red, white, and yellow one, and the black one.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else in maroon, white, and blue, but at an inexpensive price?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, that blouse is the only one in these colors.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 15, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 17, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 19, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I see. Which pants here will fit my current style best?
