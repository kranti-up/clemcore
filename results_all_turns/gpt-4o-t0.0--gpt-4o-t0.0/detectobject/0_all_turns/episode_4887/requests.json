Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello! I want to get some early shopping done today. Could you show me blouses by my favorite brand, StyleNow Feed?\nSystem: Of course! What do you think about the grey and white one on the wall?\nUser: Hmm, I don't like that pattern, reminds me of something people would wear back in the day. How about showing me dresses too?\nSystem: Ok, we have a few! What are your thoughts on the grey one in the back right, the violet one in the rack up front, or the black and olive one hanging in the far back left?\nUser: Could you tell me the brand and size of that please?\nSystem: I'm not sure which item you mean.\nUser: Oh, I'm sorry, I mean the black and white one hanging at the bottom there.\nSystem: Yes, that one is by Downtown Consignment and is a size S.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n10, blouse, white, black, S\n9, dress, violet, XL\n2, blouse, white, grey, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Nope, not won over by that brand. I think I'll go with the violet dress instead on this front rack and the white and grey blouse from earlier. I think I can use it for a vintage outfit."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-9Pg7R50Sumh1obD5TPmJ5uy1bMcAu", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n9\n2", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1715907133, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_927397958d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 6, "prompt_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 467}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 00:52:12.898951", "call_duration": "0:00:00.420294", "response": "ObjectID\n9\n2", "model_name": "gpt-4o"}}}]
