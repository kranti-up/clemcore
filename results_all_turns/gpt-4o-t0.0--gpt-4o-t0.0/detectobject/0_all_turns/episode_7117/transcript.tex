	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which sweater do you recommend for me?\\ \tt System: I have a yellow and brown one, or a dark yellow.\\ \tt User: Add those to my cart.\\ \tt System: Ok, I added them to your shopping cart.\\ \tt User: Tell me more about those two sweaters.\\ \tt System: The dark yellow one is from Brain Puzzles, and the yellow/brown one is from Garden Retail.  Both have full sleeves.\\ \tt User: Do you have any L blue shirts for me to look at?\\ \tt System: I have that one hanging in the back left.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, sweater, dark yellow, M\\ \tt 6, sweater, yellow, brown, XXL\\ \tt 12, shirt, blue, XXL\\ \tt 19, shirt, grey, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like something like that or the gray/blue one, but with full sleeves.
