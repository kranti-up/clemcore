Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi friend, maybe you can help me.  I need an area rug, and I'm trying to decide which one of these would go best in my living room.  Could you help me pick one?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think of the grey rug on the right side of the room?\nUser: Maybe, but some of those end tables actually caught my attention.  What are the black and white ones made of?\nSystem: Which end tables are you referring to?\nUser: The black one in the far corner and the white one in the leftmost corner, next to that green lamp.\nSystem: Both end tables are made of wood.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n0, EndTable, black, NA\n2, EndTable, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Do you have anything else made of wood but with more of a wooden color?  I'd like it if it was more affordable too."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-9PfpwtvETTzOB1XlA1vmXiY6CXepc", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1715906048, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_927397958d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 3, "prompt_tokens": 388, "total_tokens": 391}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 00:34:08.339195", "call_duration": "0:00:00.841586", "response": "ObjectID", "model_name": "gpt-4o"}}}]
