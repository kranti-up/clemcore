Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you think you could help me find some spotted shoes in extra small?\nSystem: There are some spotted grey ones in that size on the bottom shelf to the far left!\nUser: Wow, you're like magic! Please add those to my cart, fairy robot godmother.\nSystem: I'm so happy to help. I'll get those shoes in your cart right away.\nUser: I could also use a new hoodie.
