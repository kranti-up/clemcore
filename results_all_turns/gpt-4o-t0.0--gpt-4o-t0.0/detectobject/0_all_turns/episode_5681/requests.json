Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I want a new coat, something with full sleeves.\nSystem: Alright, I have this grey coat on the lower left that might interest you.\nUser: I'll have to see. In the meantime, can you find me a plain dress? I wear a size S.\nSystem: Sure! How about these? I have a brown dress on the back of the right floor display, a maroon dress to the right of that, and a black and olive dress on the left of the front floor display.\nUser: Oooh, can you tell me more about the sizes of the black and olive dress and the grey dress next to it?\nSystem: Of course! The black and olive dress is displayed in size S and the grey one in size XXL.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n18, dress, black, olive, S\n19, dress, grey, XXL\n10, jacket, grey, M\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Not bad.
