Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Please keep an eye out for North Lodge dresses.\nSystem: I see several! Are you a fan of maroon? There are two maroon options by North Lodge on the floor rack to the left and one behind the red dress on this first floor rack up front.\nUser: Maroon's not really my cup of tea, sorry. Let's see what you got for blouses instead.\nSystem: Sure! I spy some lovely options hanging up against that back wall. Would you wear that short-sleeved white one on the left end, the maroon, white, and blue option next to the green shirt, or the green and white blouse next to the skirt?\nUser: That grey and white blouse looks perfect for work. I'd like that one put in my cart please, and I think I'll also take one of the black and olive dresses on the right-hand side of this first rack in the middle of the floor.\nSystem: Awesome. I'll put that shirt and the dress in your rack right away!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
