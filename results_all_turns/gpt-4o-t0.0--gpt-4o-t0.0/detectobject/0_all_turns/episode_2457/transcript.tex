	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you see a good jacket? I think I want a red and white one?\\ \tt System: I found two red and white ones, there's one in the top row on the far left, and one in the middle of the middle cubby on the right.\\ \tt User: Do you have more by the same company, and the same size as the one on the right?\\ \tt System: Those two I showed you are the only ones I can find that fit what you're looking for.\\ \tt User: I'm considering some other colors. Could you compare the black one next to the red and white one on the right with the grey one on the round rack, the one to the left of the blue one.\\ \tt System: The black one has a 3.0 customer rating, while the grey one has a 3.8 rating.\\ \tt User: Can you find one that's black and expensive?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I can't.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 38, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 3, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 10, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, can you compare for the ones I was looking at first?
