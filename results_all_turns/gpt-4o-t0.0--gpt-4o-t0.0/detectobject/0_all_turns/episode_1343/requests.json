Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

I have a black dress on the very left, another black dress next to it, and a purple dress on the right side of the same floor rack.\nUser: Those are possibilities. What about a blouse, size L?\nSystem: Sure! I have a grey and white blouse on the bottom right of the right wall, another grey and white blouse two down from it, and a maroon, white, and blue blouse on the top right.\nUser: Ok, I'll think about those too. In the meantime, could you compare that second black dress to the olive one in the back?\nSystem: Of course! The black dress costs .99 and the olive one costs .99.\nUser: Great, thanks! What sizes do they come in?\nSystem: Could you clarify which items you're referring to?\nUser: The second black dress and the olive dress.\nSystem: Ok, the black dress comes in size L only, but the olive dress is available in sizes XS, S, L, and XXL.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
