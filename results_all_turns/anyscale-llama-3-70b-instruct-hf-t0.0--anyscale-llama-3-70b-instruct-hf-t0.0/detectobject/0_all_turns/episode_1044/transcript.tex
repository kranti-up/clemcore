	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, I need a new blouse today.\\ \tt System: Ok, there's a grey and white one hanging up at the top left, and a maroon, white and blue blouse hanging at the top right.\\ \tt User: Can you compare those for me?\\ \tt System: Sure, the one on the right has a holiday pattern and long sleeves.  It's from Global Voyager and a size S.  It's rated 3.8, costs .99 and comes in S, L, XL and XXL.  The one on the left has a light spots pattern.  It's made by Home Store, costs .99 and has a 3.3 rating.  That one is a size XL but it comes in XXL as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 26, blouse, grey, white, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I have the price?
