	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Any hats you can recommend?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the green one next to the white one on the table, the black one next to that, or the black one next to the other black one?\\ \tt User: Nah, but add the black jacket on the back left rack to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, I'll add that jacket to your cart.\\ \tt User: How about a hat, but cheap and in a small?\\ \tt System: I have the black hat third from the front, the white hat at the front, and the black hat between them.\\ \tt User: What's the brand and reviews for the black hat in the middle?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 41, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 98, hat, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Sorry, the one between the white hat and the other black hat.
