Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new blouse.\nSystem: Ok, I can help you with that!

Could you put them in my cart for me?\nSystem: Yes, I'll do so right away!\nUser: Awesome, could you recommend any other dark green joggers? Something plain overall with stripes down the side?\nSystem: I'm afraid those are the only ones currently available like that.\nUser: Alright, that's fine.
