	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new blouse.\\ \tt System: Ok, I can help you with that! I have a grey and white blouse on the left side, a green, violet, and pink blouse to the right of that, and a black blouse even further to the right.\\ \tt User: Those aren't bad, but I love those dark green joggers! Could you put them in my cart for me?\\ \tt System: Yes, I'll do so right away!\\ \tt User: Awesome, could you recommend any other dark green joggers? Something plain overall with stripes down the side?\\ \tt System: I'm afraid those are the only ones currently available like that.\\ \tt User: Alright, that's fine. What's the brand on that?\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt User: That grey and white blouse.\\ \tt System: That blouse is by Nature Photographers.\\ \tt User: Ok, cool. Do you have any other green denim items?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that right now. Could I help you with something else?\\ \tt User: Yeah, what about some nice shoes? Something highly rated.\\ \tt System: Ok, what do you think of these golden shoes on the bottom left of the wall display? They come with great ratings.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 61, joggers, dark green, XL\\ \tt 56, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 86, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Those are alright. How much would those blouses from before cost me?
