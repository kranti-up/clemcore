	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you please check your catalog for wooden shelves with favorable customer reviews?\\ \tt System: I have two: the shelf to the left of the wall in front of us and the one closer to the middle of that wall. The material both shelves are made of is wood.\\ \tt User: Which shelf is cheaper?\\ \tt System: The one further away from us is more expensive at ; the one closer to us costs .\\ \tt User: Can you focus on shelves from Modern Arts?\\ \tt System: The shelves you are looking at are both from this brand. Do you like them?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt 3, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt 0, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I think I will take the wooden coffee table from the other room, in front of the green couch. Please add it to my cart.
