Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Could you help me find a good quality coat with a plain pattern?\nSystem: I've got several for you to check out. There's a grey one on the left, the fourth one in on the bottom row. The fifth coat on that row is a brown one. I also have a black on the right center rack, about halfway in.\nUser: I'm actually interested in finding something more like the grey coat in color and customer rating.\nSystem: The only other option like that is the sixth coat on the left bottom row. It's also grey.\nUser: There's nothing else you can show me?\nSystem: No, I'm sorry, that's all. Can I help you in any other way?\nUser: What about a nice sweater with full sleeves?\nSystem: Let's see what we have. I've got a yellow and brown sweater in the back center of the room. Right next to it is a dark yellow one.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
