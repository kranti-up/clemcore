	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. I'm shopping for shelves today.\\ \tt System: Since you're in the market for shelves, let me suggest this wooden shelf near the brown table to the right.\\ \tt User: I'd like to add the white lamp and brown table to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure, I will add those to the cart.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in a similar price range as the brown table, but in a white color and better ratings?\\ \tt System: Sorry, it doesn't look like we have anything like that. Is there something else I can help you find?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt 4, Table, brown, NA\\ \tt 0, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Not really, but I'll take a second white lamp.
