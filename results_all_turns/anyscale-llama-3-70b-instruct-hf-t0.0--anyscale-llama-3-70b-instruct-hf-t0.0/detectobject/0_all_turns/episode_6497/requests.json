Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Would you please help me find a rug for my living room?\nSystem: Do you like either the black and white one in  the center or the grey one to the back and right of it?\nUser: What are they made of?\nSystem: The one in the center is natural fiber and has a 3.6 rating, while the other is wool and has a 3.8 rating.\nUser: Do you have anything else like those?\nSystem: Sorry, those are the two options I have like that.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
