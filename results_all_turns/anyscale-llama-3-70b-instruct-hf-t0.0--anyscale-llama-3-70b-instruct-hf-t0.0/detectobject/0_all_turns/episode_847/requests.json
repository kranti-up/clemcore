Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like to see some super marked-down tshirts.\nSystem: How do you feel about that solid green shirt hanging up to the left of that festive maroon sweater?\nUser: Actually, I might need something a little fancier. Show me blouses in extra large.\nSystem: The grey and white blouse on the far left and the two blouses to the right of the green shirt all come in extra large.\nUser: I'd like to hear the brands of those two.\nSystem: Which two would you like to know the brand of?\nUser: The one hanging on the far left and the one immediately right of the green shirt.\nSystem: The grey and white shirt is made by Home Store, while the maroon top is made by Global Voyager.\nUser: Those have the size range I'm looking for, but I'd like something with long sleeves in extra large.\nSystem: Unfortunately, I cannot find any options for your consideration. Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
