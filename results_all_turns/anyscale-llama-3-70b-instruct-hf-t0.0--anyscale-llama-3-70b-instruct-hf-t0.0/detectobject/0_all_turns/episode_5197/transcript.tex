	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm hoping to find a coat from Downtown Stylists.\\ \tt System: There are two brown options in the rack on the left.\\ \tt User: Do you have something similar to the second  brown coat on the rack in size and ratings?\\ \tt System: That coat is similar to itself, as well as a black coat on the rack on the other side of the hat display, and the light grey coat on the rack on the right in the rack closer to the front.\\ \tt User: How about a light grey jacket?\\ \tt System: There are three light grey options on the rack to the left of the hat display.\\ \tt User: Are there any other options?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have any other options.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 69, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you find me something similar to the brown coat on the left rack in brand and available sizes, but with good ratings and a size XS?
