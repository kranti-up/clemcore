	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which of these tops would be easy to mix and match with?\\ \tt System: I've got the gray and white one at the left, the Christmas one hanging in the middle and the gran and white one next to it.\\ \tt User: Could you also show me some jeans, please?\\ \tt System: I've got the dark blue ones at the far left, as well as the gray ones second from the right.\\ \tt User: You know, I think I'm gonna go with that Christmas sweater.\\ \tt System: Okay, I'll add it to your cart.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything with a good rating?\\ \tt System: No, it doesn't look like it.  Anything else I can assist you with?\\ \tt User: Any other jeans you could recommend?\\ \tt System: No, I don't have any additional pairs of jeans.\\ \tt User: Have you got any jackets with a good rating in S?\\ \tt System: I've got the brown one in the top middle on the wall, the black one at the bottom right, and the blue-green denim one at the front left of the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Anything else I could see?
