Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need some new shoes, do you have any you could recommend?\nSystem: Sure, how about these black and white shoes on the left-hand side?\nUser: What's the overall rating on those?\nSystem: For which item?\nUser: The black and white shoes.\nSystem: Those are rated at a 3.1 overall.\nUser: Oh wait, I like those hats! Please add the green hat and the black and orange hat on the right to my basket.\nSystem: Of course, I'll do that now.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
