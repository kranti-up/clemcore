	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a good sweater.\\ \tt System: Take a look at this black one on the center-right top rack of the wardrobe, and this black one to the right of it.\\ \tt User: What's the difference between the grey jacket on the front floor rack and the black one on the same rack?\\ \tt System: The grey one comes in XS and the black one comes in S and XL. They both have full sleeves.\\ \tt User: I'm interested in something like with grey jacket but short-sleeved and in an XS.\\ \tt System: I'm afraid I don't see an item that matches that criteria. Could I help with anything else?\\ \tt User: What about something in a medium size?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I cannot find an item that fits your criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 48, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 51, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 49, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt 9, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you add the green hoodie on the center-left top rack of the wardrobe to my cart, and the red, white blouse from the floor rack?
