Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey there! I'm looking for a sweater to keep me warm on a camping trip this weekend. Could you show me some options please?\nSystem: Definitely! How do you like the red and white one on the front rack?\nUser: I'll take it! It reminds me of 60's vintage style, which I absolutely love!\nSystem: Wonderful! I will add that to your cart now.\nUser: Also, could we take a look at some of your more pricey dresses?\nSystem: How about the brown one in the back rack, or maybe the maroon one there. We also have the beige one hanging on the wall.\nUser: Could you show me something similar to the purple dress on the wall in customer reviews but by Global Voyager and sleeveless?\nSystem: How do you feel about the dark brown one to its left or the other dark one on the second rack?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
