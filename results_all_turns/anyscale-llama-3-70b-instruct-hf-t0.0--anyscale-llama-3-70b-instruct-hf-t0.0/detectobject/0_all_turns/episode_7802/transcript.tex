	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Today I'm interested in t-shirts. What do you have?\\ \tt System: Check these out. I have a violet one that's the second from the left on the upper shelf. There's also a red one on the bottom shelf at the far end. Both are tee shirts.\\ \tt User: Could you describe the differences between these two shirts?\\ \tt System: I'm happy to do that. Both are folded tee shirts.\\ \tt User: How about letting me see what customers think of the grey shirt that's to the right of the violet one?\\ \tt System: Please clarify which shirt you mean.\\ \tt User: It's the grey shirt just to the right of the violet one.\\ \tt System: Here's what I pulled up for you. The customer rating is 2.7 and it's available in sizes S, M, XXL, L, XS, and XL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, tshirt, red, XS\\ \tt 5, tshirt, violet, XXL\\ \tt 2, shirt, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you toss the grey shirt into my cart please?
