	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey, what's good?  Do you have any long sleeved coats in stock right now?  It's getting to be that season, you know?\\ \tt System: How do you like the light grey coat in the middle of the top row on your right?  If you're looking for a more formal look, the two black coats under it would also be good options.\\ \tt User: Maybe something warmer, do you have any hoodies in size S?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the blue hoodie on the left?  The one on the right end of the bottom row on your left would also work, do you have any preference between those two?\\ \tt User: I'm still not quite sure I'm seeing what I want.  What about something with full sleeves by Global Voyager?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything by Global Voyager matching your description.\\ \tt User: Maybe what I want is something like the blue jacket in the upper right, or that hooded jacket in the middle, but in light grey.  Do you have anything like that?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description.  Is there anything else I could help you find?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 6, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt 0, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I think I'll just take the black coat in the upper left side of the right wall.
