	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I could use your help in selecting a sofa.\\ \tt System: What about that grey one in the very back right?\\ \tt User: I need the materials please.\\ \tt System: I apologize, but I'm not sure which item you are talking about. Could you please be more specific?\\ \tt User: I'd like info on the materials that grey sofa in the back is made of.\\ \tt System: Okay, that sofa is made of leather.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt 2, EndTable, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Word. Do you have anything for the same price as that little circular white table next to the brown couch but with a leather covering and a natural brown color?
