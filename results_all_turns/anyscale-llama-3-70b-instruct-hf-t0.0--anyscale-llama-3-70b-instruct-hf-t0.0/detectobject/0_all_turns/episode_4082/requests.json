Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new short-sleeved blouse, do you have anything by North Lodge?\nSystem: Yes, how about this grey and white blouse on the bottom right?\nUser: I'm not sure about that one, is there anything else you can show me?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I couldn't find any other short-sleeved blouse by North Lodge.\nUser: Ok, what about a brown shirt from North Lodge?\nSystem: I'm afraid I don't have any brown shirts by that brand either.\nUser: Alright, thanks for checking. Do you have anything similar to that yellow and black sweater over on the far left, but knit and more affordable?\nSystem: Sure, take a look at this pink sweater in the top center of the wall rack.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
