	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some knit sweaters?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the black one in the second cubby back on the left? There's also a pink one in the back cubby on the right.\\ \tt User: I like both of those, but need a size L.\\ \tt System: They both come in L.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me how much the brown one on that center rack costs? I'd like the rating too.\\ \tt System: Which one are you referring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 53, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 60, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 50, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 55, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The one next to that black skirt on the hanging rack.
