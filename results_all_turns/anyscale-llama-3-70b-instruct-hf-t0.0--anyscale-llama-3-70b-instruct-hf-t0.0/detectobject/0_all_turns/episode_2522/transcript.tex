	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me sweaters?\\ \tt System: I can show you sweaters. I have the red and white one up above on the right and the pink one on the left rack.\\ \tt User: Any other sweaters to show me?\\ \tt System: I have the pink one on the rack and the red and white one in the cubby.\\ \tt User: Can you compare them for me?\\ \tt System: The pink one is a long sleeve knit sweater from Uptown Gallery costing .99. The red and white one is a long sleeve holiday sweater from River Chateau costing .99.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me how much they cost?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
