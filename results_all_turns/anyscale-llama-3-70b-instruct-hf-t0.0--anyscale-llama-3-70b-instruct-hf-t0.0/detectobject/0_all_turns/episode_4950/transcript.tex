	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm trying to find a blouse, can you help me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey and white on the left, or the two white and black ones in the center shelf?\\ \tt User: I'd like something similar to the black blouse and the grey and white in the back shelf, but with a good review.\\ \tt System: I have three grey and white blouses: the one to the left, one in the center shelf, and the one in back.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
