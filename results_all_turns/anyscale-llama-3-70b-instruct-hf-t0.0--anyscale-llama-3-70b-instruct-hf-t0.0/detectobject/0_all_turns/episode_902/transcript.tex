	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a sweater in pink and in size M.\\ \tt System: There are two pink sweaters in the room you might like.\\ \tt User: What are their customer review scores and brands?\\ \tt System: Which items are you talking about? Please specify.\\ \tt User: I mean the pink sweaters against the wall.\\ \tt System: They both have a score of 3.8 and are from Uptown Gallery.\\ \tt User: Show me something with a similar price as the pink sweater but from Coats &amp; More.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no matches were found. What else can I help you with?\\ \tt User: Compare the sizes for the pink sweaters, please.\\ \tt System: They both are in size S.\\ \tt User: Really? Just go ahead and add the black jacket to my cart, then.\\ \tt System: Confirmed. It will be added.\\ \tt User: Now tell me if you recommend any coats.\\ \tt System: There is a grey coat in the back bottom row of the wall.\\ \tt User: Actually, add the grey and brown shirt to my cart!\\ \tt System: It will be added!\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 45, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 46, jacket, black, S\\ \tt 61, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Are there any sweaters you recommend?
