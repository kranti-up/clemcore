Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you think any of these sweaters are good?\nSystem: I see some excellent options on that table to the left. Do either of those maroon options closest to you look like what you were wanting? Or how about that red one that's further back?\nUser: That's quite nice, thank you. I would appreciate it if you could tell me the brand and price.\nSystem: Which sweater would you like those details on?\nUser: The red one further back on that table.\nSystem: That sweater is made by Garden Retail and sells for .99.\nUser: The maroon ones you showed me also might come in handy. What sizes are those, and which one is the better bargain?\nSystem: The maroon sweater closest to you is a medium, and it is the cheaper of the two, at .99. The other option is a large, and it costs .99.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
