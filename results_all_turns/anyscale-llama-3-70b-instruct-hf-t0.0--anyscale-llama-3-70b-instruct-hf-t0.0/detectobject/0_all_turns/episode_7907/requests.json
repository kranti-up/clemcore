Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, I'm looking for a jacket and would appreciate some suggestions!\nSystem: Of course, how do you feel about the grey and white one on the wall, the light grey one farther to the left of it or the blue one at the top right?\nUser: That light grey one looks interesting, could you tell me about how it compares to the blue one?\nSystem: Yes, the light grey one is an XL and has full length sleeves while the blue one is a L and has full length sleeves.\nUser: On second thought, they might be a bit on the plain side. Could you show me something with vertical stripes?\nSystem: I'm sorry, we don't have jackets with vertical stripes.
