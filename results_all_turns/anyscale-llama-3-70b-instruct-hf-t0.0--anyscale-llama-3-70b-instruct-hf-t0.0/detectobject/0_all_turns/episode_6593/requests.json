Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Are there any chairs that work for a dorm room?\nSystem: You can think about the white chair next to the grey couch.\nUser: What about a sofa instead that would fit in a dorm?\nSystem: Take a closer look at the grey sofa in back or the red sofa in front. What do you think?\nUser: I think those are too big. What about something like that wooden end table in back. I like the color and price on it, but by North Lodge and with natural materials.\nSystem: Sorry, we don't have anything like that.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
