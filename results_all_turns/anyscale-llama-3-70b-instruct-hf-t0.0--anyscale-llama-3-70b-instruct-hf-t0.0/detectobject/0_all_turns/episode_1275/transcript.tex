	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am looking for a tshirt with a diamond pattern.\\ \tt System: How about this brown one?\\ \tt User: Tell me about the price difference between the blue jacket and the brown one.\\ \tt System: The blue one is .99 and the brown one is .99.\\ \tt User: What's the price and available sizes of the two jackets?\\ \tt System: Which jackets?\\ \tt User: The blue one and the brown one.\\ \tt System: The blue one is .99 and available in L.  The brown one is .99 and available in M and XL.\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy both of those.\\ \tt System: Sure, I'll put them in your cart.\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a black coat.\\ \tt System: Here's one.\\ \tt User: I'd also like to see sweaters.\\ \tt System: I have a red and white one.\\ \tt User: Anything else like that one?\\ \tt System: No, just the one I showed you.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 2, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 4, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I see brown jackets with good ratings?
