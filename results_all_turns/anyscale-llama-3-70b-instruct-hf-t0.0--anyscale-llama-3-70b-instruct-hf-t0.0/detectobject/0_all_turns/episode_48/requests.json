Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me pick out a decent top?\nSystem: I think you might be thrilled with either of the multicolored, long-sleeved maroon tops on the left or the light grey tank top near them.\nUser: Is there anything else sort of like that long-sleeved festive one on the far left?\nSystem: The blouse immediately to the right is nearly identical. You might also want the grey and white polka dotted tank a little to the right.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n84, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\n3, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\n6, blouse, light grey, M\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Yeah I'm having a hard time picking up on any differences between them.
