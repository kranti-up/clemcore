	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: If there's a beautiful sleeveless Ocean Wears dress around here somewhere, let's see it.\\ \tt System: That lighter grey one hanging on the right-hand side of the rack up front might be just what you're looking for! Are you interested?\\ \tt User: Actually, let's hold the dress search. First I'd like you to find me a super swanky hoodie by 212 Local.\\ \tt System: Can I interest you in that brown one hanging on the far side of that bottom row on the right?\\ \tt User: Yeah that's pretty sweet. Mind tossing it in the cart for me?\\ \tt System: Not at all. I'll have that brown hoodie in your cart in a jiffy!\\ \tt User: You know what, that black sweater is pretty cute as well. What do customers have to say about it, and how much does it cost?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but which black sweater are you looking at?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 6, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Oh my bad, it's the black one hanging right next to the brown hoodie.
