Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new sweater to match the rest of my closet.\nSystem: Ok, I can help you with that! What about these black sweaters? I have one on the far top end of the right wall rack and another that's folded on the bottom left corner of the table.\nUser: Do you have anything by Yogi Fit that's similar to that one on the table?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I do not.\nUser: Alright, could you tell me how they compare in terms of size and overall rating?\nSystem: Of course! Both sweaters come with a 3.1 overall rating. The one on the wall is shown in size XL, while the one on the table is displayed in size S.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n15, sweater, black, S\n41, sweater, black, XL\n38, coat, black, L\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Great, thanks!
