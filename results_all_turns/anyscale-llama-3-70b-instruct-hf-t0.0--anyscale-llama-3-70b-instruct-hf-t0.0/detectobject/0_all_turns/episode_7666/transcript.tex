	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Let's see t-shirts that match my wardrobe.\\ \tt System: I can help with that. Do you like this blue grey striped one on the top right?\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry that's all I have right now. What else can I show you?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizes and prices of the two grey jeans in the back two cubbies on the right?\\ \tt System: I can help with that. The one in the far back is available in XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL. The one in front of it is available in XS, S, M, L XL, and XXL. Both of them are priced at .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 18, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you show me jackets with a two colored pattern?
