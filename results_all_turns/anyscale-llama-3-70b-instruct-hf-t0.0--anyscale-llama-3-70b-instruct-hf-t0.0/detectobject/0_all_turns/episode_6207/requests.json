Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

What sizes are those, and how much do they cost?\nSystem: Which dresses would those be?\nUser: Those two grey ones to the left.\nSystem: Both of those grey dresses are extra extra larges.
