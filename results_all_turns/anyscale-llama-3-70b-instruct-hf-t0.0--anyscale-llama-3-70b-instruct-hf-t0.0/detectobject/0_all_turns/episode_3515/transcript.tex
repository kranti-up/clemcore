	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a jacket?\\ \tt System: There are some black jackets you might want to look at. Also a grey jacket.\\ \tt User: Add the black jackets to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, those black jackets will be added to your cart.\\ \tt User: Any joggers that you recommend? I want a plain pattern with stripes on the side.\\ \tt System: There are two dark green joggers which you might like.\\ \tt User: What is the size and what are the available sizes of the black t-shirt?\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 27, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 26, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 24, tshirt, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am referring to the black t-shirt on the rack.
