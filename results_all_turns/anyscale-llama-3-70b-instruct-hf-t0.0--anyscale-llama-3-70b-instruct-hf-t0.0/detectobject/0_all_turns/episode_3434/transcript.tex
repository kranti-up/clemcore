	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find a shirt?\\ \tt System: What do you think about the two black tshirts opposite us on the floor rack?\\ \tt User: OK. What about a quality jacket?\\ \tt System: For jackets, I can offer to in red and white, one to the right of us on the floor hanger and the other one in the third compartment from the right in the cupboard closer to us.\\ \tt User: What sizes are still available for the red and white jacket in the first cupboard and the blue jacket on the right there?\\ \tt System: Which jacket are you interested in?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
