Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What do you recommend as far as blouses go?\nSystem: I bet you'll love the maroon blouse hanging up high on the left or the black one beneath it.\nUser: I definitely want something in the same color as that black one.\nSystem: I cannot find any more options in black to show you.
