	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. Are there any XL T-shirts with half sleeves?\\ \tt System: I found a blue T-shirt hanging on the back left wall.\\ \tt User: Is there anything else with a good rating that doesn't cost that much?\\ \tt System: Not that I could find, sorry. Want to make another search?\\ \tt User: Is there any T-shirt?\\ \tt System: Only the blue one I showed you.\\ \tt User: Add the red and white blouse in the back left, as well as the beige dress in the back middle rack.\\ \tt System: Sure thing.\\ \tt User: Could you make sure it's by Yogi Fit and with a good rating?\\ \tt System: I couldn't find anything like that, sorry.\\ \tt User: Okay, is there a cheap hoodie then?\\ \tt System: No, not that either. Want to search for a different item?\\ \tt User: Go ahead and add the pink sweater in the back right to my cart, along with the white and black blouse in the frontmost rack.\\ \tt System: Sure thing.\\ \tt User: Compare the prices of the black and white blouse and white, black, and red blouse in the back and front racks respectively.\\ \tt System: The black and white one is .99 while the other is .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt 34, dress, beige, M\\ \tt 60, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 48, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 71, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt 68, blouse, white, black, red, XL\\ \tt 73, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 55, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Is there something similar in available sizing and brand to the black blouse in the back rack, and the white and black blouse, except sleeveless.
