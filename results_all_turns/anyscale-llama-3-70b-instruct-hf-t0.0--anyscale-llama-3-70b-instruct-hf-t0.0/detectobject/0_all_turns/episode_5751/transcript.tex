	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have a vest that will match my other wardrobe?\\ \tt System: I can help you find a vest. I have this white one on the back side of the right rack.\\ \tt User: Can you recommend jackets with high ratings?\\ \tt System: I have this red and white one on the same rack, the the light grey one behind it on the wall, and the grey and white one hanging farther back on the wall.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the light grey one with the red and white one for me?\\ \tt System: Both of these jackets have long sleeves.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 34, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you find me something with a similar brand and color as these two jackets?
