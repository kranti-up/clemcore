	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Have you got any cheap dresses from Modern Arts?\\ \tt System: I've got these two on the left of the third floor stand.\\ \tt User: How about an affordable jacket?\\ \tt System: How about  this one straight ahead on the upper wall?\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes  and the size displayed for the two dresses I just looked at?\\ \tt System: Which one?`\\ \tt User: The two you just showed me on the third rack.\\ \tt System: They are both displayedin size XXL and they both come in XXL, S, XL, M, and XS.\\ \tt User: Do you have any North Lodge apparel with good reviews?\\ \tt System: No, nothing came back on a search.
