	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any dresses with plain patterns and in black?\\ \tt System: There is one match, a black dress against the wall on the bottom row.\\ \tt User: Okay. Compare the black blouse in the room with the grey and white blouse.\\ \tt System: The differences are as follows. The white and grey blouse has a score of 2.9, is available in XS, M, XL, and S, is white and grey, is in size S, and is 54.99. The other has a score of 4.9, is available in M, XL, L, XXL, is in black, is 54.99, and is in size XXL.\\ \tt User: Add both of those to my cart.\\ \tt System: Confirmed. They will be added.\\ \tt User: What else do you have that has a leather pattern?\\ \tt System: No matches were found, sorry. What else can I do for you?\\ \tt User: I want something like the black blouse but with full length sleeves and in a velvet pattern.\\ \tt System: No matches were found for your current search criteria.\\ \tt User: Okay, what about a regular blouse?\\ \tt System: There is a black blouse and a black and white blouse, both of which match your criteria for a blouse.\\ \tt User: Show me something like the second one. The black and white one.\\ \tt System: The only similar items are the two I mentioned previously, the black blouse and itself.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, blouse, white, grey, S\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, XXL\\ \tt 54, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What is its brand then?
