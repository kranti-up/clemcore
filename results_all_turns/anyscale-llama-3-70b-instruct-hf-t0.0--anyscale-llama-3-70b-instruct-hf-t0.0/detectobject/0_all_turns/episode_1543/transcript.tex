	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi, do you have any jackets?\\ \tt System: Yea there's a couple, one is the brown jacket at the top right, and the other is the black jacket beneath the brown one.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the price of the red and white blouse up high at the back and the white and black blouse at the front left?\\ \tt System: No problem, the red and white blouse sells for .99, while the white and black blouse has a .99 price tag.\\ \tt User: Do you have any expensive blouses?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything expensive in right now.\\ \tt User: That's ok, can I get the ratings and brand of the sweaters?\\ \tt System: Which sweaters do you mean?\\ \tt User: The two pink ones.\\ \tt System: Ok, they're actually both made by Uptown Gallery and also have a matching 3.8 customer rating.\\ \tt User: Ok.  I think I'm going to take the red and white blouse, as well as the brown coat in the middle of the room.\\ \tt System: Alright, I've added those two items to your cart.\\ \tt User: Are there any sweaters here?\\ \tt System: Yes, there's a pink sweater hanging up high, and a black sweater beside it.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 43, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 0, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt 45, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 42, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 11, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 9, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\\ \tt 14, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, are there any nice blouses?
