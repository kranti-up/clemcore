Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you show me some nice shirts?\nSystem: What do you think of the violet one on the bottom shelf?\nUser: I think I like that grey sweater better.

How about the other grey shirt on that shelf and the grey one at the end of the bottom shelf. What sizes are those?\nSystem: The one on the bottom shelf is a L. The other is an XS.\nUser: What else do you have in XS?\nSystem: I'm sorry. I don't have anything else right now. What else can I help you with?\nUser: Go ahead and give me that violet sweater on the bottom left. I'll take the red one on the top shelf too. They'll make nice gifts.\nSystem: Okay.
