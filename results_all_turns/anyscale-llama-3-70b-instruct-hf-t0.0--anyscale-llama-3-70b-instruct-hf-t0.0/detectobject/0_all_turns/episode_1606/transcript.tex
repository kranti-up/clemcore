	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you find me a  pink sweater from Uptown Gallery?\\ \tt System: What about this one on the right wall hangers?\\ \tt User: Which sweater would match my personal style best?\\ \tt System: Take a look at this black sweater and this pink one.\\ \tt User: Can you add the black sweater and the pink one to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure I'll add the black and pink sweaters to your cart.\\ \tt User: What's the size of the black and pink sweaters?\\ \tt System: Which sweaters are you referring to?\\ \tt User: I mean the pink sweater on the upper wall hangers on the right and the black sweater next to it.\\ \tt System: The pink sweater is size S and the black sweater is size XL.\\ \tt User: How different are the pink and black sweaters?\\ \tt System: The pink sweater is rated 3.8 and is from Uptown Gallery. The black sweater is rated 3.1 and is from Downtown Consignment.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 7, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Which blouse would match my style best?
