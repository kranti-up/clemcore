	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please refer me to sweaters with long sleeves.\\ \tt System: There are two pink sweaters which match your criteria.\\ \tt User: Are there any also with good reviews?\\ \tt System: I will refer you to the same pink sweaters from earlier.\\ \tt User: Refine my search parameters further to include good customer review ratings.\\ \tt System: Sorry but no matches were found. How else may I be of assistance?\\ \tt User: Show me something like the pink sweater on the bottom row of the left wall but from Cats Are Great and with an expensive price tag.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no matches could be found for your search criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 45, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 63, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 0, blouse, red, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: That's fine. Now tell me if there are any good sweaters with expensive prices.
