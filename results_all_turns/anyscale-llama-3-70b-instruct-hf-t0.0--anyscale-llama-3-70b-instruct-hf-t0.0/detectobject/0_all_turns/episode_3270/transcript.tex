	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any affordable sweaters from Coats &amp; More?\\ \tt System: The dark blue sweater on the right matches that description. What do you think of it?\\ \tt User: Is there anything similar in terms of price?\\ \tt System: Sorry, that is the only item which matches your criteria. No other item was found.\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no other items matching your search parameters was found.\\ \tt User: Okay, how about showing me a shirt?\\ \tt System: There is the blue and white shirt. What do you think of it?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, sweater, dark blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I think I want to see a hoodie instead. Any good ones?
