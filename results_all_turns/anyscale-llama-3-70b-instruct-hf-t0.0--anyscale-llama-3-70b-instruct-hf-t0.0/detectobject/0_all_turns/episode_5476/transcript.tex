	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find a coat?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey  or the black coats on the top shelf on the right or the grey one on the left?\\ \tt User: Can you suggest anything else?\\ \tt System: What about the black coat on the back shelf, the grey up front on the right, or the grey on the left?\\ \tt User: What can you tell me about the brown coat on the rack and the grey on the left shelf in back?\\ \tt System: The brown is from Downtown Stylists. It comes in small and XL, has a plain pattern with full sleeves, retails for 59.99, and has a 4.1 rating. The grey is by Art News Today. It has a 4.6 rating, is available in large, XS, and XXL, has a plain pattern and full sleeves, and retails for 59.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 36, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 7, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes and cost of the brown?
