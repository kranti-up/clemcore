Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a new tee, can you pick some out to match the rest of my closet?\nSystem: Yes, I can help with that.

Do you have anything with the same sizes as it, but sleeveless and more affordable?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I don't have anything currently available that fits that description.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
