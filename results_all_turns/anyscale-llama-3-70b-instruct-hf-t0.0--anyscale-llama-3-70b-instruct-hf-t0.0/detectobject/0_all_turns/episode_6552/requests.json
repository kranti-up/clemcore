Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello, looking for the most expensive sofas you have, I'm talking upper east side NY expensive! Just got a huge bonus from work and want to treat myself to comfort and luxury.\nSystem: I can definitely help! What do you think about the grey one to the left in the back or the red one to the right and closer to the front?\nUser: No, those might be expensive, but they don't really look like it! Let's look at area rugs instead please.\nSystem: Of course, would you be interested in something like the grey one towards the back on the right, or maybe a white one with a pattern like the one in the center?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Those are...just ok. Can you show me something with natural fibers and maybe more on the affordable side. Would only want to splurge on a sofa, not something I walk on."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-6c07a99b-9b45-4cc3-92f2-054a7ef7c045", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID:", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715916028, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 4, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 393}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 03:20:26.703090", "call_duration": "0:00:01.376824", "response": "ObjectID:", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-70b-instruct-hf"}}}]
