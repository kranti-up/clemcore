Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of these tees would go with the rest of my clothes?\nSystem: At the bottom right of the left wall, I have the blue tee you might like.\nUser: Oh, could you tell me the price of that brown hoodie on the circular rack?\nSystem: Which one do you mean?
