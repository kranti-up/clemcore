	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you direct me to a nice hoodie?\\ \tt System: Sure! Take a look at the second blue one in the top row and the  green one on the bottom row.\\ \tt User: How much do they cost and who makes them?\\ \tt System: I am not sure what item you are  interested in, could you help me?\\ \tt User: Sure! I am looking at the blue hoodie in the top row and the green hoodie in the bottom row on the wall on the right.\\ \tt System: Thanks! The blue one, from Global Voyager, costs 129.99, and the green one, from Downtown Consignment, costs 114.99.\\ \tt User: Thanks! I'll take the green one, please.\\ \tt System: Of course! I am adding it to your basket as we speak.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 11, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 8, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 10, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Also, what's different between the light grey jacket on the right  of the bottom row and the grey one next to it?
