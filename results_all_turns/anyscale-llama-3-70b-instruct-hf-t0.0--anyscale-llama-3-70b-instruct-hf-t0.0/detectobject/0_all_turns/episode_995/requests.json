Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any long-sleeved hoodies?\nSystem: What do you think of the green rack on the hanging rack to the right or the one on the wall over there?\nUser: I like the sleeves and the color of the one on the right. Do you have anything like it from North Lodge?\nSystem: I'm sorry. I don't have anything quite like that right now.\nUser: How about some dark blue jeans then?\nSystem: You're looking for dark blue jeans. How about the ones in the back corner?\nUser: I'd like them to have good reviews, and I need a size S.\nSystem: I'm sorry. I don't have anything fitting that description right now. Anything else I can find for you?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
