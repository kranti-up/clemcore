	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What have you got in slacks in XXL?\\ \tt System: I've got the blue ones in the far left cabinet.  They're what I have in XXL.\\ \tt User: Could you also show me some hoodies I might like?\\ \tt System: I've got the blue hoodie hanging in the cabinet second from the doors.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with a pattern like that blue jacket on the garment rack to the right of the hat table, but affordable and with a good rating?\\ \tt System: That blue jacket matches in both the price and rating you want, as does the light gray jacket hanging in the third cabinet from the left.\\ \tt User: Any more jackets you haven't shown me yet?\\ \tt System: No, I've got no other plain jackets with a good rating and affordable price.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 49, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 31, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 28, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the size and in-stock sizes for those pairs of pants?
