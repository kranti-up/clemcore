	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: can you direct me to a quality sweater in grey and black?\\ \tt System: I can offer you the grey and black sweater on the tiered shelf on the left. It is on the bottom tier, in the back row on the left.\\ \tt User: OK, what coats here have long sleeves, like the black one and the light grey ones in the top row on the right, but are highly rated and in grey and brown?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I do not have jackets with these characteristics at the moment.\\ \tt User: That's OK, I will buy the light-grey jacket in the bottom row on the right and the blue and white shirt on the bottom  tier, in the front row on the left.\\ \tt System: Great choices! I am updating your cart to include them right now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, coat, black, L\\ \tt 1, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 18, shirt, blue, white, XXL\\ \tt 14, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am also interested in a long-sleeve sweatshirt in a medium size.
