	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am in the market for an affordable grey t-shirt.\\ \tt System: There is a match for you on the rack.\\ \tt User: Get me the available sizes and prices for the dark brown dress and the violet dress, please.\\ \tt System: Clarify which item you are referring to, please.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 27, dress, dark brown, M\\ \tt 35, dress, violet, XL\\ \tt 24, tshirt, grey, XL\\ \tt 41, blouse, red, white, yellow, XS\\ \tt 43, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am referring to the dark brown dress and the violet dress, both on the rack.
