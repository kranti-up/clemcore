Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm hoping to find something that would work as a desk chair.  What can you show me?\nSystem: You might consider the brown chair next to the table behind the partition, the white chair on the green rug in the back, or the brown chair on wheels.\nUser: Can you tell me what those accent tables are made of?\nSystem: Which tables do you mean?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n3, EndTable, white, NA\n4, EndTable, black, NA\n8, Chair, brown, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: I mean the black accent table and the white one.
