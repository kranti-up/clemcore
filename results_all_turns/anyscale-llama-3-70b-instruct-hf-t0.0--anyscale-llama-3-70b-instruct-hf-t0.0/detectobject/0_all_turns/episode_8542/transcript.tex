	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hoping to find a nice, solid-colored coat with full sleeves. Any suggestions?\\ \tt System: This one might suit your needs. Take a look.\\ \tt User: I don't think so. Never mind. What about shirts then? Anything you think would fit with my current outfit?\\ \tt System: How about this blue and white shirt?\\ \tt User: That won't do at all. Let's try again. Tell me the available sizes and customer ratings for the grey and black jeans along the left side of the wall there.\\ \tt System: The blue/black ones have a lofty rating of 4.6 out of 5 and are currently stocked in XS and XXL. The grey ones have a slightly lower rating of 4.3 but are available in all sizes.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt 10, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Anything else you'd recommend?
