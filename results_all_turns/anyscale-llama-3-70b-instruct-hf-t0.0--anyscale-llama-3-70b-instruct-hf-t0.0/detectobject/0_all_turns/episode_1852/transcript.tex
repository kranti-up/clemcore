	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, do you have any affordably prices dresses?\\ \tt System: Sure, there are a few.  If you look at the mirror at the back left of the room, you can see a rack in front of it.  On the left side of that is a black and brown dress.  Next is a dark brown dress in the middle of the rack facing you.  Finally, to the right of that is a purple dress.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the ratings of the brown and black dress with those of the purple dress please?\\ \tt System: Of course, the black and brown dress has a high rating of 3.9, while the purple dress is rated 3.6.\\ \tt User: Do you anything similar to the purple dress but in size XXL?\\ \tt System: Actually, that purple dress is an XXL.  There's also a brown dress just to the right of it, as well as a bright purple dress hanging up on the right wall.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 20, dress, brown, black, L\\ \tt 18, dress, purple, XXL\\ \tt 16, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What do you have with good ratings?
