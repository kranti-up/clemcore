Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm gonna need some jeans in a medium.\nSystem: The outer pairs of those three on the bottom of those shelves both come in that size! Do either of those pairs strike your fancy?\nUser: Actually, the pair in the middle is drawing my eye. How does that one compare with the pair to the left of it?\nSystem: The pair shown here in the middle is a large, whereas the pair to the left is an extra small.\nUser: I'd really like something that looks like those, but I want to treat myself to something fancier, and I want something with higher reviews.\nSystem: The pair of jeans on the far right is similar to the other two.\nUser: I'm not really feeling that one. I guess I'll buy the pair on the far left. Mind putting that in my cart?\nSystem: Not at all. I will add those jeans to your cart right away.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
