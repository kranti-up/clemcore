	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you see any good chairs here?\\ \tt System: You might like the green one in the back behind the ladder bookcase.\\ \tt User: Can you also tell me what sofa here would match my style?\\ \tt System: Have a look at the red one facing away on the black and white rug or the grey one to the back left of the shop.\\ \tt User: I'll take that green chair. And I like the white lamp by the grey couch you mentioned. I'll get both.\\ \tt System: Excellent! I'll add both to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, Lamp, white, NA\\ \tt 2, Chair, green, NA\\ \tt 0, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt 6, Sofa, red, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you compare those two sofas you mentioned for me?
