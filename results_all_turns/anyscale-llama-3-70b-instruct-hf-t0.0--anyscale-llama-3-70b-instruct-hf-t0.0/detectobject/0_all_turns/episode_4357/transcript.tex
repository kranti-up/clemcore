	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see what you have in dark blue jeans made by Modern Arts please.\\ \tt System: I've got two pairs, the dark blue ones in the far right cabinet, and the other dark blue pair in the cabinet just to the left.\\ \tt User: How about something in multicolored?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I don't seem to have any jeans like that.  Could I help you look for something else?\\ \tt User: How about giving me a look at some hats I'd like?\\ \tt System: On the left hat table, I've got the black hat second from the back, the green camo hat next to it, and the dirty green color beanie further toward the back.\\ \tt User: i want to get that beanie, and also the dark blue jeans second from the right.  Please add them to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure, I'll add the beanie and jeans you your cart now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 61, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt 68, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 67, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 11, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I get the price and brand for that brown blazer hanging on the rack to the right of the second hat rack, and that gray blazer hanging in the cabinet above the jeans I bought?
