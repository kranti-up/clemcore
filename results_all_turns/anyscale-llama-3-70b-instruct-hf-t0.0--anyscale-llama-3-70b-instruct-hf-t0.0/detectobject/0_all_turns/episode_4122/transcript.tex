	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you recommend a hoodie for my style?\\ \tt System: How about this blue hoodie here at the top left shelf of the left wardrobe, and this brown hoodie on the top middle shelf of the right wardrobe?\\ \tt User: Could it be something expensive?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have any expensive hoodies.\\ \tt User: What's the difference in brands between the brown and blue hoodies?\\ \tt System: The brown one is a 212 Local hoodie and the blue one is a Global Voyager hoodie.\\ \tt User: What's the brand of that one?\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 0, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The brown one.
