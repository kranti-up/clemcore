	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which jacket do you think I'd be able to mix and match with the majority of my outfits?\\ \tt System: In the top row, I've got the blue jacket in the middle, and on the bottom row, I've got the gray and white one second from the left, and the red and white one on the far right.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the brand and rating of the blue one and the red one?\\ \tt System: The blue one has a 2.8 and is made by Home Store, and the red one is from Coats & More and has a 3.3.\\ \tt User: I'd like that purple shirt at the top left and the gray and white jacket you showed me to be added to my cart.\\ \tt System: You've got it.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with a similar price and pattern as the gray and white one, but made by Downtown Stylists and in red and white?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately I don't have any jackets like that.  Could I assist you with anything else today?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 9, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 0, tshirt, purple, XL\\ \tt 6, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Please add the blue jacket, and another of that gray and white jacket to my cart.
