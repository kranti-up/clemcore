Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hey, what's good?  Do you have any long sleeved coats in stock right now?  It's getting to be that season, you know?\nSystem: How do you like the light grey coat in the middle of the top row on your right?  If you're looking for a more formal look, the two black coats under it would also be good options.\nUser: Maybe something warmer, do you have any hoodies in size S?\nSystem: What do you think of the blue hoodie on the left?  The one on the right end of the bottom row on your left would also work, do you have any preference between those two?\nUser: I'm still not quite sure I'm seeing what I want.  What about something with full sleeves by Global Voyager?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything by Global Voyager matching your description.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
