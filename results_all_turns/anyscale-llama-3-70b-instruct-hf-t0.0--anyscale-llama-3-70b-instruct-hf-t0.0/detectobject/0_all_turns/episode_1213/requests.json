Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm here to see jackets.\nSystem: There's two nice jackets, one in black and the other in brown, hanging at the very end of this wall on the left. There's also a great brown option in the very back on the left end of the top row. Are any of those close to what you were picturing?\nUser: That brown jacket at the end of the top row on the left is almost perfect. I want something in that size by that brand, but I was hoping for strong customer reviews and short sleeves.\nSystem: My apologies, but there are no short-sleeved jackets with high ratings in that size by the same brand.\nUser: Well that's a let-down. Oh well. I'd like to know the sizes of those two hoodies please.\nSystem: Woops, it isn't clear which hoodies you're talking about. Could you be more specific?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n40, jacket, brown, XL\n44, jacket, brown, XL\n27, dress, dark brown, M\n68, jacket, brown, XL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: The two green ones.
