Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Your task is to find me a coffee table that other buyers are very keen on.\nSystem: Do either of the brown options intrigue you?\nUser: Um, I'm looking for something white and extravagant.\nSystem: Oh, then I'm afraid there are no options for you to look at here.\nUser: It's not the end of the world. Show me a sofa instead?\nSystem: I think you'll be quite taken with that grey one in the back!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\n1, Sofa, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Yeah, that fits the bill.
