	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, do you have any cheap hoodies in size S?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything matching those parameters.\\ \tt User: Can you compare the black and white striped blouse at the front right with the black blouse on the bottom rack at the back of the room?\\ \tt System: Sure, they're both hanging blouses.\\ \tt User: Can I have the sizes?\\ \tt System: For which items?\\ \tt User: The two blouses we were just talking about.\\ \tt System: Sure, the striped one is size M, while the black one at the back is size XXL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt 6, blouse, black, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar in sleeve length and customer rating  to the black one, but in a size XXL.
