Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I lost my favorite hat. Can you help me find a new one?\nSystem: Sure. Do you like the black hat in the middle or the first white hat, or the black and orange hat?\nUser: Do any of them have a good rating?\nSystem: The green hat to the left and the black hat in between the white ones, and the the white hat to the right of the black and orange one all have great ratings.\nUser: I like the white hat you recommended in brand and price, but want a better rating.\nSystem: I think the green hat on the left may suit your needs best.\nUser: How does that green hat and the black hat in between the white ones in the back compare?\nSystem: The black one and the green one are both hats.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
