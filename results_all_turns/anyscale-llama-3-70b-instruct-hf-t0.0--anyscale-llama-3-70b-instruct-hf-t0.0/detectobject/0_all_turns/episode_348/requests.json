Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of these pants would be a nice new addition to our wardrobe?\nSystem: I've got the green ones in the far left cabinet, and the gray ones in the second cabinet.\nUser: Have you got any more I could see.\nSystem: No, I don't happen to have any other pairs.
