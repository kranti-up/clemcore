Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there, I'm looking for a shirt today. Would appreciate your suggestions!\nSystem: Of course, how do you feel about the yellow one above the grey pants?\nUser: Could you tell me the price of that one?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which one did you mean?\nUser: The yellow one you just suggested.\nSystem: Yes, that one is .99.\nUser: Ok, I'm really not sure if yellow is my color. Could you show me some coats in an XXL instead?\nSystem: Sure! How do you like the black one on the rack on the right in the back? We also have a black one on the right rack in the front and a black one above those same grey pants from earlier.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n25, shirt, yellow, M\n75, coat, black, L\n27, coat, black, L\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok, happy that I have options!
