	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: So I'm shopping for tee shirts today that are well reviewed!\\ \tt System: Let's try these. The second from last item on the top left row is a purple tshirt. I also have a white tshirt on the extreme right side.\\ \tt User: I'm actually scoping out the light blue and light green jacket at the far back of the room. Could you add that to my cart please?\\ \tt System: Yes, indeed. I'm adding it to your cart right now.\\ \tt User: Let's narrow down my search a bit to a half sleeve in a medium.\\ \tt System: Nothing came up for a half sleeve in size M with good customer reviews.\\ \tt User: Then could you pull up something like the white one in color and brand but in a medium size?\\ \tt System: No, all I have is the white tee.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, jacket, light blue, light green, M\\ \tt 25, tshirt, white, S\\ \tt 19, shirt, grey, blue, XXL\\ \tt 12, shirt, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'm looking at the grey and blue shirt that's the first one on the left bottom row and the sixth shirt on the same row, the blue one. How do the labels stack up?
