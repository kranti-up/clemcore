Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Could you please look for some full-sleeve hoodies?\nSystem: Are you into that green one hanging behind the white shirt on the second floor rack?\nUser: Nevermind, I want a Modern Arts dress.\nSystem: Okay!

Add it to my cart if you don't mind.\nSystem: Wonderful! That hoodie will appear in your cart in just a sec.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
