	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have suits made by Art Den?\\ \tt System: I have the black and red one on the back of the table.\\ \tt User: Any others?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, that's all the suits I have made by Art Den.\\ \tt User: I'll buy it then.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll put that suit in your cart for you then.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see something else with similar sizes and color as that black t-shirt on the table but with half sleeves.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that right now.\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy both of those blue and green jackets on the table.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll put them in your cart now.\\ \tt User: Can you show me cheap pants?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?\\ \tt User: I would like to buy the green t-shirt up on the wall and the dark blue jeans on the far left.\\ \tt System: Ok, I'll add those to your cart now as well.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the sizing options for both pairs of jeans?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 65, suit, black, red, XL\\ \tt 67, tshirt, black, L\\ \tt 50, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt 64, jacket, blue, green, XXL\\ \tt 25, tshirt, green, XL\\ \tt 57, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 35, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The dark blue pair on the far left and the grey pair two spots over.
