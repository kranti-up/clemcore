	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a leather chair, do you have any?\\ \tt System: I have this brown chair on the right.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with a similar color and rating to those two wooden shelves against the wall, but more affordable and from the brand Home Store?\\ \tt System: Sorry, there's nothing that matches those criteria.\\ \tt User: Ok, could you tell me what the brand and materials of those two shelves are?\\ \tt System: Both shelves are made of wood and are by Modern Arts.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt 2, Shelves, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to buy the shelves on the left.
