	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi! I was hoping you could help me find some red shoes today? Most of my clothes are neutral in color, so I need something to make them pop more.\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think about the ones under the dark blue jeans?\\ \tt User: Maybe, but could you tell me the reviews for that one?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, which one would you like to know that for?\\ \tt User: The red ones you suggested, under the dark blue jeans.\\ \tt System: Yes, those have a 2.5 customer review.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 56, shoes, red, L\\ \tt 32, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 23, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, guess they aren't that great. Oh well, let's look pants then. Tell me a little about the the blue ones four from the left in the back and also the grey ones in the very corner back.
