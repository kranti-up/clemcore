Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello, I need a new shirt to match the rest of my clothes.\nSystem: There are several on the table, including violet, grey and brown options.\nUser: Do you have anything similar to the violet or grey shirts but with short sleeves?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't seem to have anything like that right now.\nUser: What do you have with good reviews and short sleeves?\nSystem: I don't have any shirts matching that description right now.\nUser: Are there any nice sweaters?\nSystem: There are, on the same table as the shirts you can see a dark violet sweater, a grey sweater and a dark grey sweater.\nUser: Ok.
