	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a coat, please?\\ \tt System: There are several. A brown coat and two grey coats which match your criteria. What do you think?\\ \tt User: What is the size of the grey coats?\\ \tt System: Which item are you talking about?\\ \tt User: The grey coats on the right rack.\\ \tt System: The grey coat on the right is available in XXL and the other is in XS.\\ \tt User: Okay, tell me more differences for them.\\ \tt System: The only difference I can tell you now is the same size difference.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 11, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Show me something like those coats but in XXL and with a denim pattern.
