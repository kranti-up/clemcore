	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some trousers that go with my wardrobe, please.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the green trousers or the grey trousers?\\ \tt User: Show me something else like the white, maroon, and blue blouse in terms of price and brand.\\ \tt System: Sorry, that is the only item which matches your criteria.\\ \tt User: I want to see some blouses with good reviews. What have you got for me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the black blouse, the maroon, white, and blue blouse, and the black and white blouse?\\ \tt User: What are the available sizes and size for the black and white blouse?\\ \tt System: Which one are you talking about?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 0, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am referring to the black and white blouse on the wall.
