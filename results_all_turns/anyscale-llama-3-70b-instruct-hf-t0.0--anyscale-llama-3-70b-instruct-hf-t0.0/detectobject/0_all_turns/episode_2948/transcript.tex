	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like a North Lodge rug please.\\ \tt System: How about this gray one on the right?\\ \tt User: Actually, first I need a gray sofa.\\ \tt System: Sure there's one for you to look at in the back right.\\ \tt User: Can you show me something like the rug from before, but cheaper and wooden?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything meeting those criteria.  Anything else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, AreaRug, grey, NA\\ \tt 0, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt 4, CouchChair, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yes, please add the black end table and the white armchair to my cart.
