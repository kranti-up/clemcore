	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see some long-sleeved sweaters.\\ \tt System: I have a red and white one the rack straight ahead. What do you think?\\ \tt User: What about an affordable, long-sleeved coat?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything like that to show you. How about something else?\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like that red and white sweater, but from Cats Are Great?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but I don't have anything like that either.\\ \tt User: I'll take the red and white sweater.\\ \tt System: Sure. I'll add that for you now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 77, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Make that two of them, please.
