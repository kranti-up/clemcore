	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me a blouse that goes with my wardrobe.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the black blouses or the white and black blouse?\\ \tt User: Tell me how the black coat compares with the grey coat on price.\\ \tt System: The black coat has a price of 139.99 while the grey coat has a price of 59.99.\\ \tt User: What do you have that is like the white and black blouse and the black blouse on the rack color wise but with good reviews and that is expensive?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but no item matches your search criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 11, coat, black, L\\ \tt 32, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 26, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else you got?
