	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some tops that would spruce up my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: In the leftmost cabinet I have the black and white striped one, as well as the red zig-zag one, and in the cabinet to the right of the mirror I have another black and white one.\\ \tt User: Have you got any tops in S?\\ \tt System: In the cabinet two to the right of the mirror, I have the dark gray top at the right, which is S.\\ \tt User: Have you got anything like that crazy zig zag top, but in XL with good reviews?\\ \tt System: For that request I have both of the white and black striped tops you saw, as well as the black one all the way on the right.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 4, blouse, black, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the rating for the striped one?
