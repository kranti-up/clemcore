	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Keep an eye out for nice sweaters.\\ \tt System: Please share your thoughts on the black one hanging up in the back right and the other black one folded up on the near end of the table in the back left.\\ \tt User: That black one hanging up is pretty sweet, but I'd really like a design by Yogi Fit. Think you can find something like it by that brand?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I do not see any Yogi Fit sweaters similar to that one.\\ \tt User: Alright, well could you check for something by Uptown Gallery? I'd consider that brand as long as it's got top reviews.\\ \tt System: I apologize, but I do not see any sweaters by that brand either. Is there something else I can offer my assistance with?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 41, sweater, black, XL\\ \tt 10, coat, black, L\\ \tt 7, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 56, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: We can try looking for coats instead of sweaters. What's good in black around here?
