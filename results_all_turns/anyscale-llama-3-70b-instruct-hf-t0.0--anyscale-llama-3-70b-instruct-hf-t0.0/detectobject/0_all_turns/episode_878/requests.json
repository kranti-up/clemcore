Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Yo, I'm looking for brown tshirts.

Adding it now.\nUser: How does the blue jacket on the bottom row compare to the brown jacket on the top right on ratings? And what sizes do both of them come in?\nSystem: The blue jacket is only available in L with a 2.8 rating.
