	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey there, I'm looking for a jacket with good customer reviews.  Could you help me navigate this big room?\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think of the red and white jacket on the wall straight back?  If those colors clash too much for you, you might like the blue jacket hanging up in the middle of the right wall, or the black one to your immediate right.\\ \tt User: Can you get me the price of the black one and the blue one, and also tell me what customers are saying about them?\\ \tt System: Sure, could you clarify which jackets you're referring to?\\ \tt User: The black and blue ones you just suggested a second ago, the black one on my immediate right and the blue one hanging up in the middle of the right wall.\\ \tt System: The black jacket costs .99 and has a customer rating of 4.0.  The blue one costs .99 and has a customer rating of 4.8.\\ \tt User: Add the black one to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure thing, I've added it to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 23, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 7, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else in a size XXL that's a little cheaper?
