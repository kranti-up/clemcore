Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm looking to buy some luxury jeans that have reviewers falling head over heels.\nSystem: Those two jeans in the back to the left are a match! Do either of those suit your preferences?\nUser: Yeah, I could get on board with those. Which one is more popular with buyers?\nSystem: The lighter pair is more highly rated, with a nearly unbeatable average customer rating of 4.9. The darker pair also comes highly recommended, with an average score of 4.6.\nUser: Good to know. Can I also get you to look for something in the same vein as that violet blouse hanging up to the right or the green, violet, and pink one near it, but by the brand Downtown Consignment?\nSystem: That brand makes the green and white shirt hanging above the light-wash jeans to the left.\nUser: Hm okay and what are the rating figures on that red jacket and the grey one?\nSystem: Woops, I'm not certain which jackets you're talking about.
