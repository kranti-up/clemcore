	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which of these tees would go with the rest of my clothes?\\ \tt System: At the bottom right of the left wall, I have the blue tee you might like.\\ \tt User: Oh, could you tell me the price of that brown hoodie on the circular rack?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?  There are two next to each other.\\ \tt User: The one to the right, I mean.\\ \tt System: That is an XXL.\\ \tt User: Can you put the hoodie on the left into my cart?  It looks more my size.\\ \tt System: Sure thing.  I'll add it now.\\ \tt User: Have you got other hoodies I could see?\\ \tt System: At the moment, just the two brown hoodies you already saw.\\ \tt User: Do any of the hoodies have a good rating?\\ \tt System: Both brown hoodies have a good rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 50, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 47, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'm also interested in seeing some blazers.  What have you got with a good rating in a plain pattern?
