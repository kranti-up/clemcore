Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Is there a hat in size S?\nSystem: There are multiple black hats along the table.\nUser: Tell me the difference between the two black hats on opposite sides of the table.

The one next to the white hat is in XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
