Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: COuld you show me a few pairs of jeans please?\nSystem: I've got the dark blue pair closest to you, the gray ones next to them, and another gray pair in the furthest cabinet.\nUser: I'll take the dark blue pair, and the gray ones next to them.\nSystem: I'll update your cart.\nUser: Have you got any tops in a white and gray combo?\nSystem: At the bottom left on the wall, I have that gray and white top.\nUser: I'd like something in a similar size and brand as that, but in green, violet, and pink.\nSystem: I don't have any tops like that.
