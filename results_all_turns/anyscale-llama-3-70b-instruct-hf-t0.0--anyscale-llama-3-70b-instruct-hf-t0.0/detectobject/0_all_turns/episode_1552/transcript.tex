	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new jacket.\\ \tt System: Ok, take a look at these three. I have a black jacket on the bottom right, brown jacket above it, and another brown jacket in the top center.\\ \tt User: Are there any others you could show me?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, there's nothing else at the moment. Is there something else I can help you with?\\ \tt User: Yeah, tell me about the display sizes on those two brown jackets.\\ \tt System: Sure. The jacket in the middle is shown in size S, while the one on the end is shown in size XL.\\ \tt User: Great, thanks! Now, what about an expensive sweater from Uptown Gallery to surprise my sister with?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I don't have any expensive sweaters from Uptown Gallery at the moment.\\ \tt User: That's alright. Do you have anything more affordable that's got the same color and sizing options as those two brown jackets?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, there aren't any other similar items that fit your description.\\ \tt User: Alright, thanks anyway. Do you have any nice blouses I could look at?\\ \tt System: I do! There's a maroon, white, and blue blouse on the top right of the wall rack, a grey and white blouse in the bottom middle, and another grey and white blouse on the right side of the back floor rack.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 40, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 2, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 9, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\\ \tt 11, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with the same price tag as that grey and white blouse on the floor or the tri-color blouse on the wall, but in a medium?
