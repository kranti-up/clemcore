	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some assistance picking out a nice white lounge chair by Modern Arts.\\ \tt System: Tell me your thoughts on those two backless beige pieces!\\ \tt User: Hang on a sec, actually I'd like to look at tables that other buyers have been very pleased with.\\ \tt System: Turn your attention if you will to that lovely brown table on the blue floral rug in the back right corner!\\ \tt User: Oh wow, I actually really dig that chair that's next to the table. And that black end table on the far left isn't too shabby. I want both of those in my shopping cart.\\ \tt System: Great! I'll get those in your cart for you.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, Chair, white, NA\\ \tt 4, EndTable, black, NA\\ \tt 11, AreaRug, red, NA\\ \tt 6, Table, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Throw in that red rug while you're at it, and I guess you're right about that brown table back there. I'll take that as well.
