	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. I'm looking for a coat.\\ \tt System: We have three jacket you might enjoy. If you look the back left on the rack there are two coats. There is a black coat and another black coat to the left of that. You can also see the grey coat hanging in the closet to the right. It is above the grey pants. What do you think?\\ \tt User: Can you actually tell me the difference between the red and white jacket in the closet and the dark colored jacket on the middle table?\\ \tt System: The red and black jacket has a rating of 3.3, and the dark color jacket is 5.0.\\ \tt User: Would you get me the size and rating for the dark color jacket on the middle table and the the red and white jacket?\\ \tt System: Which items are you referring to?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 11, jacket, dark green, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I mean the dark blue and green jacket atop the middle table and the red and white jacket above the grey pants on the right rack.
