Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, could you help me look through shoes?  I'm on the hunt for something casual, but if I find something nice looking for work that'd be alright too.\nSystem: What do you think of the red shoes in the leftmost shelf of the center display?  The black ones in the third bottom cubby from the right against the wall would also work well for any occasion.\nUser: Actually, some other stuff is already jumping out at me.  Add that blue jacket on the far right rack to my cart, and also the light grey jacket in the fourth cubby from the left up against the wall.\nSystem: Certainly, I've added both items to your cart.\nUser: Now could you tell me about the brown coat on the near left rack and the black coat on the near right rack?  What's the difference between them?\nSystem: The brown coat is full-sleeved and priced at .99, and the black coat is long-sleeved and priced at .99.\nUser: Are there any other coats you could recommend?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the brown coat on the near left rack to the right of the one you were just looking at, or maybe the one in the third cubby from the right against the wall?  If you wanted something in black, I also have another black coat in the third cubby from the left.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
