Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any nice accent chairs with a good rating and made of leather?\nSystem: Based on those criteria, I have the brown chair in the partitioned area, the white chair next to the table on the green rug in the back, and the brown wheeled chair on the red rug.\nUser: I'd like to see something like that one with the wheels, but in the cheap range, and red?\nSystem: I don't have any chairs like that, unfortunately.  Could I help you find something else instead?\nUser: How about a chair by Modern Arts?\nSystem: No, I don't happen to have any Modern Arts chairs in stock.  Is there anything else you'd like to see?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n8, Chair, brown, NA\n7, Chair, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: I'll go with that white chair in the back you showed me before.
