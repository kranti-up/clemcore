	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, do you have any green hoodies?\\ \tt System: Sure, there's a green hoodie hanging above the grey pants.\\ \tt User: Speaking of those grey pants, can you get me the size and price for them?  And for the dark blue pants beside them?\\ \tt System: I can!  The grey pants are XS and cost .99.  The dark blue pants are XXL and have a price tag of .99.\\ \tt User: What do you have at a more affordable price?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have any other affordable items.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 14, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, well I really love both of the trousers, can you put them in my cart?
