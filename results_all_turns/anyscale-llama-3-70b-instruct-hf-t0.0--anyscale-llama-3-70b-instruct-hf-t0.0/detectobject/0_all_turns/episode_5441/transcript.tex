	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you recommend a tshirt for me?\\ \tt System: There is a white shirt on the rack to the right, a grey one that is first on the bottom, and a black one on the back row of mannequins.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything in light grey that is a jacket?\\ \tt System: How is this one on the right rack in the middle, or the last one on the rack below it?\\ \tt User: How does the black shirt on the mannequin compare to the first white shirt on the top rack?\\ \tt System: The white one is Cats Are Great and has a design, and the black is HairDo and is plain.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, tshirt, white, XS\\ \tt 5, tshirt, black, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What is the brand and price of those shirts?
