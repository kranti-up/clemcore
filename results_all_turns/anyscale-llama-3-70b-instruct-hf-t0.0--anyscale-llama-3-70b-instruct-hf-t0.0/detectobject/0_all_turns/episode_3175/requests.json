Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Any good blouses in here?\nSystem: We have lots of blouses to choose from! Here are three for your perusal.\nUser: I'm liking that black and white one. Any more like that?\nSystem: Yes indeed. Take a look at these other two.\nUser: What about some solid colored ones, in XS?\nSystem: How about this purple one? Does it strike your fancy?\nUser: Yes, it's perfect! Cart.\nSystem: Great! That item is now in your cart. Anything else I can help you with?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n7, blouse, white, black, S\n4, blouse, violet, XL\n0, blouse, white, grey, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Yeah, actually.
