	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me pick out a jacket?\\ \tt System: There are two hanging on the wall: a brown and a blue. What do you think?\\ \tt User: The grey shirt and the grey and brown beside the wall on the table, what can you tell me about them?\\ \tt System: Both are folded t-shirts.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with a similar brand and pattern as the olive and white shirt on the table or the dark pink and white, but in a S?\\ \tt System: I have that dark pink and white shirt as well as the grey and brown by the wall.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, shirt, grey, XXL\\ \tt 6, shirt, grey, brown, M\\ \tt 8, shirt, olive, white, S\\ \tt 12, shirt, dark pink, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the rating and size of that one?
