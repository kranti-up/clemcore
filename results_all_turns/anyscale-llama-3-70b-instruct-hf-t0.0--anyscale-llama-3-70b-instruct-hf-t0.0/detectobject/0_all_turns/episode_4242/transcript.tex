	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi could you help me find a duffle or a lined jacket?\\ \tt System: Take a look at the two black coats and the grey coat on the right and left of the blue jacket.\\ \tt User: I'll take the grey one on the left and the black one just next to it.\\ \tt System: Great, I've added these two coats to your cart.\\ \tt User: I'm also in the market for a pair of blue jeans.\\ \tt System: I can help you find a pair of jeans. I've located three pair that might be of interest to you: the blue jeans second to last on the left, the grey jeans under the white and grey wind breaker, and these darker shade jeans on the far right.\\ \tt User: I'm looking for a more brown shade.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry I couldn't find any jeans in brown.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 19, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 20, coat, black, L\\ \tt 56, hat, white, M\\ \tt 54, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you tell me what size these hats are and if they come in anything else?
