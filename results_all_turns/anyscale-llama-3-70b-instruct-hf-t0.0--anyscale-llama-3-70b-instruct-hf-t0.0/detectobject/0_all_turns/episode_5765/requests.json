Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Is there a t-shirt with half length sleeves or a design pattern that you can recommend?\nSystem: There is a green t-shirt and two white t-shirts which match your criteria.\nUser: Show me something with the same price as the black t-shirt and the brown t-shirt but from Home Store.\nSystem: Sorry, but those are the only items which match your criteria.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
