	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like t-shirts by Modern Arts.\\ \tt System: I can help you find that. I have this white and black one on the rack in the front of the room.\\ \tt User: Can you show me some large jeans?\\ \tt System: I can help with that. I have the grey pair in the cubby to the right of the mirror.\\ \tt User: I'd like something like the grey and white jacket on the front rack and the grey and white one up in the cubby on the left but in red and XXL.\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have something like that. Can I get you anything different?\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry I can't find something like that. What else could I get you?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 55, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 3, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the rating of the grey and white jacket on the front rack and the grey and white jacket hanging up on the wall?
