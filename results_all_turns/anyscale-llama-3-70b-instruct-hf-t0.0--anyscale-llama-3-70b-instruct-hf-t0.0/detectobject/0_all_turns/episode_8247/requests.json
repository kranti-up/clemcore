Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

There's also a funky red and green one in the back by the window for you to consider.\nUser: Hm yeah those two might do the trick. But tell me the label first.\nSystem: Which pieces are you seeking further information on?\nUser: Oh woops, I mean the red and green sweater in the back and the grey one at the far end of that lower table.\nSystem: The red and green sweater is made by River Chateau, while the grey sweater is made by Downtown Consignment.\nUser: I'd also like to see some blouses in extra large.\nSystem: Give this black one right up front and that black one way in the back by the green hoodie a look!\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
