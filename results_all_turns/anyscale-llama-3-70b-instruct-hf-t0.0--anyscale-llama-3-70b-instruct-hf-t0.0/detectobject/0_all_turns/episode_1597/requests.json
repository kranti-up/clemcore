Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'd like to find a shirt made by Uptown Studio.\nSystem: I did find a couple of things by Uptown Studio.

There's also the black one hanging on the rack just below that.\nUser: I'd like to find something like the two blouses you just showed me.\nSystem: I only have these two items to show you.\nUser: Please compare the available sizes for those blouses.\nSystem: The first one hanging up against the windows is available in XXL, S, XL, and L while the black one is available in XS, S, and XL.\nUser: What shirt would match my wardrobe best?\nSystem: Consider these options.
