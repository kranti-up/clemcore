	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new jacket to match the rest of my closet, can you show me some?\\ \tt System: Sure! I have a black jacket on the bottom right and two blue jackets further down the right wall up top. What do you think of those?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me what sizes those two are?\\ \tt System: Which ones are you referring to?\\ \tt User: The two blue jackets.\\ \tt System: Both of those jackets are displayed in size S.\\ \tt User: Alright, thanks. While I'm thinking about the jackets, can you compare the dark grey blouse on the bottom right to the maroon, white, and blue blouse on the bottom of the far left?\\ \tt System: Sure! The dark grey blouse is plain and the multicolor blouse has a holiday pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 1, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 9, blouse, dark grey, S\\ \tt 7, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, what do you have that's from Downtown Consignment?
