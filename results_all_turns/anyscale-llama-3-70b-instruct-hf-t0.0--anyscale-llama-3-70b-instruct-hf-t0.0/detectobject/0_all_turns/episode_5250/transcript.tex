	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Please show me some blouses.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the white and black blouse, the black blouse, or the grey and white blouse? They all match your criteria.\\ \tt User: Show me something else like the white and black one.\\ \tt System: There are several similar blouses you might like. Take a look at the maroon, white, and blue blouse and the other white and grey blouses.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 5, blouse, white, black, XS\\ \tt 4, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 30, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 9, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Great because I am in the market for some blouses. What else you got?
