	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some pants that won't look frumpy with my other clothes.\\ \tt System: There's a camo pair and a dark blue pair on the left you might like. There's also a grey pair in the second cubby back on the right.\\ \tt User: What brand is the dark green hat at the end of the shelf?\\ \tt System: Which one do you mean?\\ \tt User: I think it's the sixth one back.\\ \tt System: That hat is from Downtown Stylists.\\ \tt User: Oh, okay. The pants you showed me on the left, what sizes do you have in those?\\ \tt System: The dark blue ones are available in XS, S, L, and XXL. The camo ones are an XL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 23, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt 33, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 43, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have any other good pants?
