	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you pull up some trousers for me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the brown trousers in the shelf?\\ \tt User: What else do you have?\\ \tt System: Sorry, no other item matches your search criteria.\\ \tt User: Okay, can you now show me a hoodie that goes with my sense of style?\\ \tt System: There is a brown hoodie and a blue hoodie in the closet which you might like. What is your opinion on them?\\ \tt User: Add the blue hoodie and the brown hoodie to my cart.\\ \tt System: Okay, they will be added to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 1, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 4, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add a black coat to my cart as well.
