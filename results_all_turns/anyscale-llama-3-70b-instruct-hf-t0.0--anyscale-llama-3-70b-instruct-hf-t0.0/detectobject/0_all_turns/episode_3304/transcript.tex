	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some trousers from River Chateau.\\ \tt System: There is a pair of brown trousers which matches your criteria. What do you think?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the difference between the blue jackets? I want the differences between the available sizes and the price.\\ \tt System: The blue jacket on the right is in L and costs .99 while the blue shirt on the left is in S, M, XL, and XXL and costs .99.\\ \tt User: Is there anything like the blue jackets in terms of brand and customer reviews?\\ \tt System: Sorry, those are the only items available to match your criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 14, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 10, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 4, tshirt, green, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What is the size of the green and white t-shirt?
