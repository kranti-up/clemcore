	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi! I need a jacket with twin colors.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the red and white jacket?\\ \tt User: Are there any others you'd recommend?\\ \tt System: Nothing I could find. Do you wanna make another search?\\ \tt User: Do you have something like the red and white jacket in pattern except with short sleeves and a good rating.\\ \tt System: I couldn't find anything matching that criteria.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 23, shoes, black, S\\ \tt 28, shoes, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you compare the rating of the black shoes to the other black shoes? They're beside each other under the brown pants.
