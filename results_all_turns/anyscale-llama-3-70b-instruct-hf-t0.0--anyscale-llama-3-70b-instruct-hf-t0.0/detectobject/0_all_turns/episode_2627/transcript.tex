	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi. I need a coat by Pedals and Gears.\\ \tt System: Take a look at the very back. On the top row, the fourth from the left is a black coat. On the bottom row  are two other black coats, one is third from the left and the other is fifth from the left.\\ \tt User: Add the one on the top row to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure, I'll add it now.\\ \tt User: I'd like something like the black coat on the bottom right.\\ \tt System: The grey coat on the top row is similar, aside from the two black ones on the bottom.\\ \tt User: Compare the sizes of the grey coat on the right wall in the front to the black coat on the back wall, bottom row, third from the left.\\ \tt System: The front grey coat is in XS while the black one is in XL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 18, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 12, coat, grey, XS\\ \tt 17, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 8, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Add the grey jacket in the back left to my cart.
