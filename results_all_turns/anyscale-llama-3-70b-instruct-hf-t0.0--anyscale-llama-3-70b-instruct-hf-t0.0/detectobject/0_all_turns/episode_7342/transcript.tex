	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Alright, today's shopping adventure is all about finding a full sleeve hoodie made by Global Voyager!\\ \tt System: On the bottom left side you'll see a Global Voyager blue hoodie with full sleeve.\\ \tt User: Are there more options?\\ \tt System: No, I couldn't see anything else with your specifications.\\ \tt User: Let's compare two jackets at the back of the room. The second from the left, the light blue and light green one on the table, and on the bottom row against the back wall there's a light grey one hanging up, the first one in the row. How do they compare in available sizes?\\ \tt System: The one on the table is available in sizes S, XS, M, XL, L, XXL and the light grey one hanging up is available in XXL, S, and XL.\\ \tt User: Give me the one on the table please.\\ \tt System: I'll do it for you now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, jacket, light blue, light green, M\\ \tt 14, jacket, light grey, XL\\ \tt 22, coat, black, L\\ \tt 7, coat, black, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like a comparison between the black jacket on the far right and the one hanging up in the back of the room, top row on the right.
