	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any good blouses you can pull up for me?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the red, white, and yellow blouse or the black blouses?\\ \tt User: What else is there that is like the first option in terms of available sizes and customer review scores?\\ \tt System: No item matches your criteria.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else to show me?\\ \tt System: No, there is no other item to recommend which matches your specificities.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, blouse, red, white, yellow, XS\\ \tt 11, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 16, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 3, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 8, shirt, yellow, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Let's move to pants. How do the grey trousers compare with the brown ones?
