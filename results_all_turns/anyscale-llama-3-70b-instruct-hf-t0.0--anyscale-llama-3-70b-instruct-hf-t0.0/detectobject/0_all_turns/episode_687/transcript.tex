	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Have you got any blue pants I could see today?\\ \tt System: In the cabinet closest to the door I have that blue pair.\\ \tt User: Have you got any leather jackets to show me?\\ \tt System: I've got the brown one hanging in the second closest cabinet.\\ \tt User: How about something in green and white?\\ \tt System: No, I don't happen to have any green and white leather jackets.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 85, blouse, red, white, yellow, XS\\ \tt 97, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 92, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 87, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I get the size and rating for the gray and white top in the cabinet closest to the door, and the red and yellow one in the cabinet next to it?
