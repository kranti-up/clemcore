Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a black sweater.\nSystem: Ok, how about this black sweater in the center of the display?\nUser: I'll think about it. In the meantime, do you have anything expensive in green and white that has a similar pattern to those two pair of jeans on the left?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything to match your description.\nUser: Alright, could you compare those two pair of jeans on the left for me then?\nSystem: Of course! Both jeans have the same sleeve length. The blue and black jeans cost .99 but the blue jeans cost only .99.\nUser: Which pair do you think would go best with the rest of my closet?\nSystem: Both of these jeans might be of interest to you.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
