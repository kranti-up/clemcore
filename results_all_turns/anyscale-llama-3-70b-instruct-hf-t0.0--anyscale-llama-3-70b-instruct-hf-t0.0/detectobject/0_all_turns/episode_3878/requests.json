Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me choose a chair?\nSystem: Certainly! All of my chairs are on the right, in the displays further down the room. First, on the right, on the red rug between two room dividers, you will see a chair in brown. If you look further in the same direction, you'll see another brown chair in the display on the right of the partition. Finally, in the display on the left side of the same partition, you will see a white chair.\nUser: Thanks. Do you have couches like the grey one in the furthest display on the left, the one that is facing right? I like the color but would prefer a higher customer rating and leather upholstery.\nSystem: That couch is the only one like that.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n2, Sofa, grey, NA\n8, Chair, brown, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: OK.
