Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Got any good jackets around here?\nSystem: Check out those jackets on the set of shelves to the right! Do either of those black options speak to you? Or would you consider that royal blue between them?\nUser: That blue is stunning, actually, and I might could go for the black one to the left of it. Which one would save me some dough, and what sizes could I get both of them in?\nSystem: The blue one is considerably less expensive, at .99 in comparison to the black jacket's price of .99. The blue jacket is available in a large, while the black jacket comes in small and extra large.\nUser: I'm curious to know if you could dig up something by Twin Colors that other customers just rave about?\nSystem: In fact, that white and grey jacket on the far right is made by that brand and has excellent ratings! Are you interested?\nUser: I'm lukewarm on that one, to be honest. Got anything that's available in the same sizes as the blue one and the black one to the right of it?\nSystem: Unfortunately, there are no matches.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n10, jacket, blue, L\n9, jacket, black, XL\n1, jacket, black, XL\n22, hat, dirty green, XXL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Alright, just drop the jackets for the time being. I'll buy that dirty green hat to the right of the white hat, if you could please put it in my cart for me."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-6e98cc6e-afce-4e7f-a3a2-49e27b4edc95", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID: 22", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715912127, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 6, "prompt_tokens": 516, "total_tokens": 522}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:15:25.973228", "call_duration": "0:00:01.531448", "response": "ObjectID: 22", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-70b-instruct-hf"}}}]
