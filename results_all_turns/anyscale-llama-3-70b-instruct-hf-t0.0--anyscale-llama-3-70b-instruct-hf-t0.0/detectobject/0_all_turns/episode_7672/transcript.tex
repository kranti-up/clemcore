	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any dresses with good reviews and short sleeves which you can recommend me?\\ \tt System: The black dress on the right wall matches your search criteria.\\ \tt User: Are there any good jackets that you see?\\ \tt System: There is a blue jacket, a grey jacket, and a black jacket. All of them are jackets.\\ \tt User: How do the blue jacket and black jacket compare on customer review scores and price?\\ \tt System: The former is 39.99 and has a score of 39.99 and the other is 174.99 and has a score of 174.99.\\ \tt User: Add the blue jacket to my cart. Also the black jacket.\\ \tt System: Okay, both jackets will be added to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 27, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What are the review scores for them?
