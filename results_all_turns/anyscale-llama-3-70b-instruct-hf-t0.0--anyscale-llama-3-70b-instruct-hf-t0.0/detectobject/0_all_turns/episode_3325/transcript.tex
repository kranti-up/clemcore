	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have a air of trousers which you can point out for me?\\ \tt System: There is a pair of brown trousers and a pair of green trousers which match your criteria. What do you think of them?\\ \tt User: Tell me how the brown trousers and green trousers differ.\\ \tt System: They brown trousers are .99 and the other pari is .99.\\ \tt User: What else do you have that you can recommend?\\ \tt System: Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria. What else can I do to help you?\\ \tt User: What is the brand of the blue hoodie and the brown hoodie?\\ \tt System: Which item are you talking about?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 6, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 8, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt 1, hoodie, blue, S\\ \tt 3, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I am talking about the blue hoodie and the brown hoodie on the left wall.
