	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, could you lend me a hand with finding a coffee table?  I'd like something made of wood if you can.\\ \tt System: What do you think of the wooden coffee table at the far end of the room, in front of the blue sofa?\\ \tt User: Actually, forget it, I think I'm gonna thrift the coffee table.  What about some shelves?\\ \tt System: I have a few options for shelves; how do you like the wooden shelves on the left end of the near wall?  If you want something with closing doors, I can also offer the wooden shelving unit on the right end of that wall.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, AreaRug, white, NA\\ \tt 1, AreaRug, red, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Sorry to be so changeable, but what about your rugs?  Could you tell me the prices of the white and black one nearest to me and that red one in the back?
