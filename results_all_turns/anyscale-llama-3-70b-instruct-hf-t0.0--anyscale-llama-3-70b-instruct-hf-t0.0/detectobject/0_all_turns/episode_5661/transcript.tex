	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What have you got in hoodies you can show me?\\ \tt System: At the back wall, I have the blue hoodie on the far right of the top rack, on the right wall, I have the green hoodie in the middle of the middle rack, and the other green one at the left side of the lower rack.\\ \tt User: Please add the green hoodie on the lower rack to my cart.\\ \tt System: Sure thing, I'll add that one to your cart.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me more about both green hoodies?\\ \tt System: Both are made by Downtown Consignment and have a 2.8 rating.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 33, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 11, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 19, coat, black, L\\ \tt 32, tshirt, dark green, L\\ \tt 29, tshirt, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: That black coat in the middle of the bottom row in the back looks nice, do you have any others like that in blue and white?
