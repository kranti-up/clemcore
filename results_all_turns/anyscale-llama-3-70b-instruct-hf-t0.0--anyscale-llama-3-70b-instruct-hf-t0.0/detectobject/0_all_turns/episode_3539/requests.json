Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any dresses to match my wardrobe?\nSystem: Sure, what do you think about this black dress on the top right?\nUser: Do you have anything else similar to it in terms of sleeve length and the size options?\nSystem: I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything else similar. Can I help with something else?\nUser: What about a coat, do you have any suggestions?\nSystem: I have this black coat just left of center on the top rack.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, dress, black, XL\n5, blouse, maroon, white, blue, XS\n0, blouse, black, S\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Oh wait.

The black one next to the dress, and the maroon, white, and blue one below the coat?"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-a712952c-389f-48ae-ad68-971b8671fb55", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID: 0, 5", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715911239, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 9, "prompt_tokens": 380, "total_tokens": 389}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 02:00:37.679010", "call_duration": "0:00:01.464497", "response": "ObjectID: 0, 5", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-70b-instruct-hf"}}}]
