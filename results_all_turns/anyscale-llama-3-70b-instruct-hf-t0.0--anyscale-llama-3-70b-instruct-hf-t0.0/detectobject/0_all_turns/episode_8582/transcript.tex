	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any shirts that go with my closet?\\ \tt System: There is a blue shirt and a white and black shirt in the back. They match your closet.\\ \tt User: Add the white and black shirt to my cart, as well as the blue jacket on the left.\\ \tt System: Confirmed.\\ \tt User: Now show me some blouses in size XL.\\ \tt System: What is your opinion of the black blouse or the grey and white blouse?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, shirt, white, black, XXL\\ \tt 0, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 2, blouse, grey, white, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What do you have that is like the grey and white one?
