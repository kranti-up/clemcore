	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to see your collection of sleeveless dresses please.\\ \tt System: In the bottom row, I've got the purple dress on the left, the maroon one in the middle and gray dress on the right.\\ \tt User: I'd like something like the purple one or the maroon one, but with an affordable price.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately I don't have any dresses that fit the bill.  Anything else I could help you with?\\ \tt User: Can I also see what you have in expensive long sleeve dresses?\\ \tt System: We don't currently have any long sleeve dresses in stock.\\ \tt User: I think I'll go with the purple dress today then.\\ \tt System: I'll add that to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, dress, purple, XL\\ \tt 4, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 5, dress, grey, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Make it a second of the purple one, and that gray dress as well.
