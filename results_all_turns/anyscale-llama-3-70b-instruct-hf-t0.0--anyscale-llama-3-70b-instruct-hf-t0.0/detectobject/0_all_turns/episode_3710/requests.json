Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello there, could you kindly suggest something high-end with shelves please for my chateau?\nSystem: Certainly, would you be interested in tall shelves to the back?\nUser: Oh, it's hideous! It is far too simple for me. Please show me some area rugs instead, I'll just find the shelves elsewhere since it looks like that's the only one you have.\nSystem: Yes, how do you feel about the white one in the back or perhaps the red one towards the right?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, Chair, brown, NA\n8, Chair, brown, NA\n7, Chair, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Actually, you have such a lovely chair back there behind the far wall.
