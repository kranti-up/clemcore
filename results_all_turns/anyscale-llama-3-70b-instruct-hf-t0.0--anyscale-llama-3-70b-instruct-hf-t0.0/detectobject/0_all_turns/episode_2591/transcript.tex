	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like to look at small blouses with good ratings.\\ \tt System: I have the white and grey one on the top right, the white and grey one in the top middle, and the black and white one all the way to the left.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the available sizes of the black and white one?\\ \tt System: Which one?\\ \tt User: The black and white blouse all the way on the left.\\ \tt System: This blouse is only available in small.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt 8, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 11, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to see options from HairDo with heavy stripes.
