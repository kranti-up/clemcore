	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which of these pants would be a nice new addition to our wardrobe?\\ \tt System: I've got the green ones in the far left cabinet, and the gray ones in the second cabinet.\\ \tt User: Have you got any more I could see.\\ \tt System: No, I don't happen to have any other pairs.  Could I help you find something else?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me about the prices for the black long-sleeve top at the front of the garment rack, and the black and white diamond print one to the right of it?\\ \tt System: The black one is 59.99, the black and white one is 74.99.\\ \tt User: Have you got any green pants that you could show me?\\ \tt System: I've got the green camo pants you saw previously.\\ \tt User: How about some full sleeve jackets with a good rating.  Have you got any I can see?\\ \tt System: I've got the bright blue jacket at the front left of the garment rack, the gray and white one at the far right of the second cabinet, and the black one at the top right of the wall.  All have full sleeves and good ratings.\\ \tt User: Have you got any blue-black jeans that you think I would like?\\ \tt System: The third closest pair of jeans on the left are a blue-black rinse.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me about the light gray jacket in the third cabinet from the door, and the black jacket at the front of the rack?\\ \tt System: The light gray one is from 212 Local, has a 2.6, costs 44.99, is an XL, comes in XXL, S, XL, has full sleeves and a plain pattern.  The black one is from Yogi Fit, costs 174.99 is XL, comes in S, XL, has full sleeves and a plain pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
