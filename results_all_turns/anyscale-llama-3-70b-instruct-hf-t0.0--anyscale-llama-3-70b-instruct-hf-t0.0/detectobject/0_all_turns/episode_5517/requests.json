Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hello, do you have any jackets for me to check out?\nSystem: Sure, hanging straight ahead of you below the blue and white shoe boxes is a lovely light grey jacket.  At the far right end of the same shelving unit is a blue jacket.   Finally, there's another blue one hanging on the round rack over at the back right.\nUser: Can you get me the ratings for the blue ones?\nSystem: Definitely, the one over on the circle rack is rated 4.8, while the one on the shelving unit is rated just 2.8.\nUser: Ok.
