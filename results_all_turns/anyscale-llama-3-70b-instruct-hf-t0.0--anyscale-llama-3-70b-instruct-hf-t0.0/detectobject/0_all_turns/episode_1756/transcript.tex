	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you help me find some jeans?\\ \tt System: Let us start with the blue-black jeans in the further cupboard on the right, on the rightmost shelf in the bottom row. Do you like them?\\ \tt User: Can you show me any good trousers?\\ \tt System: If you are looking for trousers, I can suggest  the grey ones on our right and the blue ones in the next cupboard, in the second shelf of the bottom row.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 47, trousers, blue, XXL\\ \tt 59, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Thank you! Which of these trousers have higher customer ratings? Also, what sizes are they?
