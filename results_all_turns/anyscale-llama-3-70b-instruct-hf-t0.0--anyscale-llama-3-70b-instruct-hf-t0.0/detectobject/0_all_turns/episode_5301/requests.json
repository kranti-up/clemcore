Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi there assistant! I'm in need of some fashion expertise today. Could you help me find a sleeveless dress for this birthday party I'm going to please?\nSystem: Certainly! What do you think about the black dress right in front here on the closest rack, the dark brown one behind it to its left or the purple one to its right?\nUser: You know, maybe I should get a jacket instead, I forgot that it's going to be unusually cold that day. Could you tell me how the brown jacket on the wall on the right is different from the grey one on the table to the left?\nSystem: Of course! The brown plain hanging one has a 3.5 customer review, is available in XL and M, is by Coats & More, has long sleeves, priced at 199.99 and a size XL. The leather grey one on display has a 3.8 customer review, is available in XXL, XL, XS, S, M and L, is by Art News Today, has full length sleeves, priced at 239.99 and is a size M.\nUser: Hmm, I really cannot decide between a dress or jacket. I love dresses, but will freeze if it's cold and I don't have a jacket. Could you tell me how much the black dress costs?\nSystem: I'm sorry, which one did you mean?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
