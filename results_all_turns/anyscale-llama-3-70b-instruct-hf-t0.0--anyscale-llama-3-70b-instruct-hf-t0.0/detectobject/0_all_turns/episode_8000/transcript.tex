	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there some nice blouses here in your opinion?\\ \tt System: See how you feel about that funky red, white, and yellow knit option, the black studded tank, and the green, violet, and pink blouse.\\ \tt User: Actually I'm feeling more drawn to that black blouse with the zigzags. Got anything else for the same price?\\ \tt System: If you like that black blouse, you might love the other black blouse near it and the dark grey one a cubby to the right.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 0, blouse, dark grey, S\\ \tt 2, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 6, blouse, white, black, S\\ \tt 1, blouse, green, violet, pink, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I'd like to see more options with good reviews.
