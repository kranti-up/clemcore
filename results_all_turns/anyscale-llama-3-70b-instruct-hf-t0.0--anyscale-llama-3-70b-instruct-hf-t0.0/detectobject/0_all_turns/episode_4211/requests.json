Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Any good coats in here?\nSystem: I found this one you might like.\nUser: Can you tell me the price and size please?\nSystem: I'd be happy to. Which item are you interested in?\nUser: The coat you just showed me, of course.\nSystem: It is being sold for .99 and shown in a size large.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n14, coat, black, L\n12, dress, black, M\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Black is probably best.
