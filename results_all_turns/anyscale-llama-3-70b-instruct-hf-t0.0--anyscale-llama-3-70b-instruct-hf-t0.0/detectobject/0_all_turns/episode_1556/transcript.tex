	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find a long-sleeved sweater?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey and black sweater on the middle shelf, the green on the bottom, and the red on the top?\\ \tt User: Anything from Glam Nails?\\ \tt System: I have the grey sweater on the middle shelf. Do you like it?\\ \tt User: I'd like a shirt, please.\\ \tt System: There is a white and grey shirt on the bottom shelf, as well as a violet and a grey on the middle shelf. What do you think?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
