	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you help me find some plain jeans?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the grey jeans on the right?\\ \tt User: Will you add the grey pants on the left to my cart?\\ \tt System: Of course. I've added those for you.\\ \tt User: Do you have the available sizes of the grey and white blouse and the maroon, white, and blue?\\ \tt System: Can you be more specific which blouses you mean?\\ \tt User: The grey and white blouse on the top left and the maroon, white, and blue on the top right.\\ \tt System: The former comes in XL and XXL, while the latter is available in XXL, S, XL, and L.\\ \tt User: Do you have something like those two blouses but with a holiday pattern?\\ \tt System: The maroon, white, and blue blouse is the only option I have right now.\\ \tt User: I'll take the maroon, white, and blue blouse as well as the grey pants on the bottom left.\\ \tt System: No problem, I'll add both of those for you now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 34, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 26, blouse, grey, white, XL\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt 57, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 56, blouse, green, white, XL\\ \tt 39, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you show me some shirts, please?
