Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Is there a pair of bottoms here that would groove with stuff I wear a lot?\nSystem: How about something in a darker color?

Could you please put them in my cart?\nSystem: Of course! I'll put those brown pants in your cart right away.\nUser: Is there by chance anything else with the same size range and sleeve length as those?\nSystem: My apologies, but I cannot find any items that fit your request.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n13, trousers, brown, XS\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: It's okay.
