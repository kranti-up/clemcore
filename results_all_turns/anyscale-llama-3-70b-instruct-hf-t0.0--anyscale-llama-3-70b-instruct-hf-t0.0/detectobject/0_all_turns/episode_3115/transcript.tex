	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey there, how're you doing?  Could you show me any coffee tables you have that have a good customer rating?  I'm sick of buying stuff that disintegrates in a month.\\ \tt System: Sure, how do you like the wooden coffee table on the white rug on the right?  If you want something with more surface area, the coffee table on the blue rug to your left would also be a good choice.\\ \tt User: I like the one on the right, wrap it up for me.\\ \tt System: Sure, I've added that one to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt 6, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else similar to it by the brand Modern Arts?
