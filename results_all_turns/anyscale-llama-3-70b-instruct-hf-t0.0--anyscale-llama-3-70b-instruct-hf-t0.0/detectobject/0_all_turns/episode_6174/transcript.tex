	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi, what's up?  I'm looking for a new bed- my son grew out of his old one.  Could you show me some options?\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think of the two grey beds on the green rug up against the wall?\\ \tt User: I want one with a backboard for sure- give me the one on the left.\\ \tt System: Certainly, I've added it to your cart.  Is there anything else I can help you find?\\ \tt User: Could you tell me what brand those two beds are real quick?\\ \tt System: Both beds are made by the brand StyleNow Feed.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, Bed, grey, NA\\ \tt 4, Bed, grey, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have any cheap rugs as long as we're here?
