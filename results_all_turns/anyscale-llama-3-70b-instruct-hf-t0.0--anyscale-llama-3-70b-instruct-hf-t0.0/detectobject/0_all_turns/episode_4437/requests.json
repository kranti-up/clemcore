Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I'm trying to find some nice sweaters. See anything?\nSystem: What are your thoughts on that pink one hanging on the top row on the right or the black one to the right of that?\nUser: Wait that maroon blouse with the funky pattern is so clutch! And I like the grey thing hanging beneath it. Can you tell me how those stack up please?\nSystem: The blouse on the bottom is grey and white and a size large, while the top above is maroon, white, and blue and is a size extra small.\nUser: The grey and white seems like the more sensible purchase. I'd like to have that in my cart if you don't mind.\nSystem: Great! I'll put that in your cart right away.\nUser: Now maybe you can help me find a long-sleeve black coat?\nSystem: Do you like that black one to the left of the maroon patterned top on the right?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
