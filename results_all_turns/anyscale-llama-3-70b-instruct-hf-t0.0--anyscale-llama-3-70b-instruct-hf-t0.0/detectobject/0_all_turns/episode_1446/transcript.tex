	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any nice jeans from Cats Are Great?\\ \tt System: Here are some jeans I found.\\ \tt User: Can you show me some more jeans?\\ \tt System: I have these two options for you.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me more about their brands?\\ \tt System: The dark blue ones come from Modern Arts and the grey ones are made by Cats Are Great.\\ \tt User: Please add one of each to my cart.\\ \tt System: I will do that now.\\ \tt User: Actually on a second thought, I think my sister would enjoy those too, add one more pair of the gray ones for me please.\\ \tt System: I have added another pair of the grey pants to your cart.\\ \tt User: I am also looking for some shirts that would go well with the pants I just got.\\ \tt System: Here are some shirts.\\ \tt User: Which of them would match my stuff?\\ \tt System: Maybe this violet one? It goes well with a nice pair of jeans.\\ \tt User: Iâ€™ll take it too! Great choice!\\ \tt System: I have added that shirt to your cart.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
