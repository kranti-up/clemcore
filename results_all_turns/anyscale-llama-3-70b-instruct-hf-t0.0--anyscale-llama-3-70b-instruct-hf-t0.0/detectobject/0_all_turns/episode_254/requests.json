Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Keep an eye out for nice sweaters.\nSystem: Please share your thoughts on the black one hanging up in the back right and the other black one folded up on the near end of the table in the back left.\nUser: That black one hanging up is pretty sweet, but I'd really like a design by Yogi Fit.
