	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want some blouses in a plaid pattern.\\ \tt System: How do you feel about the red, white yellow blouse here at the front? It has a plaid pattern.\\ \tt User: Anything else with long sleeves and from Downtown Consignment?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't see anything else that matches your search criteria. Can I help you with something else?\\ \tt User: What about any nice tshirts?\\ \tt System: Take a look at this white one on the far back table, the violet one in front of it, and the red one to the left? They are all tshirts.\\ \tt User: What's the difference between the white one and the red one?\\ \tt System: The white one is available in sizes XXL, L, S, L, M, and S, with a price of 79.99 and the red one is available in size S, priced at 29.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, tshirt, white, XXL\\ \tt 8, tshirt, red, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What's the reviews of the two shirts?
