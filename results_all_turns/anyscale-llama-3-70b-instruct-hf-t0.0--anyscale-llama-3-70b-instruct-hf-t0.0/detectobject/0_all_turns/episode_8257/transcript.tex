	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some new blouses, please show me what you have available.\\ \tt System: Ok! Take a look at these. I have a black blouse at the far end of the wall on the bottom, another black blouse on the floor rack directly in front, and a black and white blouse just to the left of that.\\ \tt User: Actually, I also need a sweater. Can you compare the green sweater on the center shelves to the red and white sweater hanging in the back on the left?\\ \tt System: Of course! Both sweaters are by River Chateau. The green sweater comes in M and XL and has an average rating of 2.5, while the red and white sweater comes in all sizes XS through XL and has a 3.6 average rating.\\ \tt User: What about something from North Lodge? Preferably in size S.\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think of this grey and white blouse on the upper left? It's from North Lodge and is displayed in size S.\\ \tt User: Hmm, not sure. Do you have anything similar to the black and white blouse up towards the front in terms of sizing options, but just black?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything that fits your criteria at the moment. Can I help with something else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 14, sweater, green, XL\\ \tt 1, sweater, red, white, L\\ \tt 2, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What about a long-sleeved blouse, can you show me anything like that?
