	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What do you recommend as far as blouses go?\\ \tt System: I bet you'll love the maroon blouse hanging up high on the left or the black one beneath it.\\ \tt User: I definitely want something in the same color as that black one.\\ \tt System: I cannot find any more options in black to show you. Would you like to know more about that one?\\ \tt User: Help me pick out one of these sweaters instead. See anything that would work with my look?\\ \tt System: Let me know what you think of the red sweater on the top shelf up front, the purple option a shelf down, and the grey sweater right next to it in the other row.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 78, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 59, sweater, grey, XL\\ \tt 70, sweater, red, M\\ \tt 55, blouse, maroon, white, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the price of those two and what sizes they are?
