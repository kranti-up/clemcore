	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a new shirt, what do you have that's well-rated in a vertically striped pattern?\\ \tt System: There's this white and grey shirt towards the far right corner of the bottom shelf of the display table.\\ \tt User: I like the brand on that light red shirt that's in the back middle of the bottom shelf, do you have anything by them that's more expensive and in a size XXL?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. Is there something else I can help with?\\ \tt User: Yeah, what about a cheap long-sleeved shirt?\\ \tt System: Ok, check these three out. In addition to that white and grey shirt, I also have a brown shirt on the same side that's second from the front, and a violet shirt on the front corner of the middle shelf.\\ \tt User: Great, what's the label and available sizes on those?\\ \tt System: Could you clarify which ones you mean?\\ \tt User: The violet top and the white and grey one.\\ \tt System: Ok, the white and grey top by North Lodge is available in sizes XS, M, L, and XL, while the violet top from Art News Today comes in sizes S through XL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 64, shirt, light red, XL\\ \tt 52, shirt, white, grey, L\\ \tt 75, shirt, violet, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Great! What's the brand on those again?
