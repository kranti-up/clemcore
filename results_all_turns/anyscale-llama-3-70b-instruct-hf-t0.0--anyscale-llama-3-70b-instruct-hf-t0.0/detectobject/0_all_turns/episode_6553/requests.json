Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

Just got a huge bonus from work and want to treat myself to comfort and luxury.\nSystem: I can definitely help! What do you think about the grey one to the left in the back or the red one to the right and closer to the front?\nUser: No, those might be expensive, but they don't really look like it!

Can you show me something with natural fibers and maybe more on the affordable side. Would only want to splurge on a sofa, not something I walk on.\nSystem: I'm sorry, I couldn't find any area rugs meeting your preferences.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
