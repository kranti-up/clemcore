	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, what jackets do you have with good ratings?\\ \tt System: I have a blue one and a grey one, htey're both on the circular rack at the end of the counter.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar to the grey one at an affordable price point?\\ \tt System: Actually, the blue on I mentioned fits that description.\\ \tt User: Do you have any affordable hoodies with full-length sleeves?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have anything like that right now.\\ \tt User: What else do you have for me?\\ \tt System: I don't have anything else matching any of your previous searches.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 12, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt 13, hat, black, S\\ \tt 10, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, I'm going to take that green hoodie on the rack, as well as the black hat up front on the counter top please.
