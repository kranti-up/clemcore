Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: What do we have here in the way of area rugs?\nSystem: Do these strike your fancy?\nUser: Maybe, maybe. Any wooden tables from Art Den?\nSystem: We have this one here.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
