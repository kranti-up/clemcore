	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am interested in sweatshirts that your other customers have found good quality.\\ \tt System: We have some quality sweaters folded on the tiered rack on the left. Take a look at the pink one at the end of the back row on the bottom tier; the maroon one right above it in the middle tier; and the blue one in the middle of the front row on the  bottom tier.\\ \tt User: Which sweater has better reviews, the folded maroon one or the pink one hanging in the top row on our right?\\ \tt System: The pink sweater is rated slightly higher, 3.8. The maroon one is rated 3.4.\\ \tt User: What other sweaters are good?\\ \tt System: Let's take a look at some more folded sweaters: the brown one in the middle of the middle tier, the green one at the far end of the back row on the bottom tier, and the dark grey one at the end of the front row on the bottom tier.  Do any of these interest you?\\ \tt User: OK, any nice jackets from Global Voyager?\\ \tt System: I can offer you the brown jacket in the top row on the right. What do you think?\\ \tt User: Lets focus on the brand Coats & More.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I have nothing by this brand. Would you like to look for anything else?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 17, sweater, maroon, L\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yes, what nice short-sleeve top from Home Store can you show me?
