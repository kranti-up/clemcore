	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any coats in XXL?\\ \tt System: I do, there's a black coat and two grey ones on the rack at the front right, all of which come in XXL.\\ \tt User: Do you have any more?\\ \tt System: Sure, up at the top left of the shelving unit is a grey coat, with a black one to the right of that.\\ \tt User: What do you have similar to that brown hoodie to the left of the bright blue jacket?\\ \tt System: Well there's another brown hoodie to the left of the other one, and there's another brown hoodie right at the bottom right up front.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 21, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt 5, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I get a rating and available sizes for the brown hoodies?
