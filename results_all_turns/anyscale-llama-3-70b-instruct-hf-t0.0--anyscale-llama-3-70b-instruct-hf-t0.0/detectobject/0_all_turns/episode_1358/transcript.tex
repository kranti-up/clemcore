	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What blouse do you think I'll like?\\ \tt System: Check out the maroon, white, and blue blouse in the top row on the wall hanger to the left of the window in front of us, the grey and white one on the left in the same row, and the green and white one to the right from the maroon, white, and blue blouse.\\ \tt User: Thanks! can you tell me what the difference is between the black dress on the floor rack on our right, on the other side of it, and the brown one on the rack in the middle of the room?\\ \tt System: Of course! The black dress is rated 4.0, and the brown one has a slightly higher rating of 4.2.\\ \tt User: I will buy the brown dress--please add it to my cart.\\ \tt System: Of course! it will be in your cart in a moment.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 41, dress, black, M\\ \tt 51, dress, brown, M\\ \tt 47, dress, red, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Thank you! Can you show me a nice tshirt with half sleeves?
