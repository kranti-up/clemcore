Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you help me pick out a decent top?\nSystem: I think you might be thrilled with either of the multicolored, long-sleeved maroon tops on the left or the light grey tank top near them.\nUser: Is there anything else sort of like that long-sleeved festive one on the far left?\nSystem: The blouse immediately to the right is nearly identical. You might also want the grey and white polka dotted tank a little to the right.\nUser: Yeah I'm having a hard time picking up on any differences between them. What sizes do those come in? And can you get a read on the customer ratings?\nSystem: Which items are you interested in learning more about?\nUser: Those first two tops on the far left.\nSystem: Both of those tops are offered in small, large, extra large, and extra extra large, and they both carry a customer rating of 3.8.\nUser: I think I feel ever so slightly inclined towards the one on the far left. How does one compare to the solid light grey tank?\nSystem: The long-sleeved blouse is rated more highly. It has a 3.8, in comparison to the light grey tank's rating of 2.9. The blouse on the left is also available in more sizes. It comes in small, large, extra large, and extra extra large, while the grey tank is only available in medium at this time. While the tank features a solid pattern in a nice light grey color, the top on the left features a holiday pattern in a maroon, white, and blue color scheme. The brands of these shirts also differ. The tank is made by Brain Puzzles, while the long-sleeved blouse is made by Global Voyager. The actual sizes of these pieces are also different. The tank is a medium, while the long-sleeved top is a small. Last but not least, these shirts are both priced at .99.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
