	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need a super affordable jacket.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that at the moment. Would you like to look for anything else?\\ \tt User: Do you have more jackets like the red and white one on the top right and the blue one to the left of it?\\ \tt System: The grey jacket on our left would be similar, as would the leftmost  blue jacket in the top row  and the light grey jacket  hanging second in the bottom row on the wall on the right.\\ \tt User: Thanks. Is the red and white jacket on the right by a good brand, and what's its size?\\ \tt System: Could you please explain which jacket you are taking about?\\ \tt User: Sure, I mean the red and white jacket on the top right on the wall to our right.\\ \tt System: Thanks! I've got the information you requested. That jacket is by Coats & More. It is displayed in size XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: OK. What plain shirts can you recommend?
