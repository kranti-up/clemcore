	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any well-reviewed coats?\\ \tt System: I have a light grey coat on the right and a brown on the rack to the left. What do you think?\\ \tt User: What brand is the light grey?\\ \tt System: Which item do you mean?\\ \tt User: The light grey coat hanging on the wall to the right.\\ \tt System: That coat is from StyleNow Feed.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 23, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 50, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 62, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 64, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt 58, blouse, black, S\\ \tt 28, tshirt, violet, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with a similar brand as that light grey coat and the brown one on the rack?
