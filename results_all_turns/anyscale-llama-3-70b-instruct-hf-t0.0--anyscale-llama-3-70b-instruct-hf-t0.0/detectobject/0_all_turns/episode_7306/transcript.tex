	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me some good jeans?\\ \tt System: I'd be happy to! We have some nice jeans  in the lower row in the cupboards along the wall facing us. I suggest the first pair from the left, in light blue,  and the third par from the left  in the first cupboard, in blue,  and the first blue pair from the left in the second cupboard.\\ \tt User: These are nice! I will take the light-blue pair and the first pair from the left in the second cupboard,\\ \tt System: Sure! I am adding them to your basket as we speak.\\ \tt User: I am also interested in something like the second blue pair in the cupboard on the left, but I want it to have heavy stripes.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, we have no jeans in that pattern todaty.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 9, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt 27, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 21, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 37, shoes, black, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: That's OK. I am also looking at the black shoes in the second shelf from the left in the smaller rack closer to us. Can you tell me what sizes you have and if they have good customer reviews?
