	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there. Can you tell me if you see any trousers by River Chateau.\\ \tt System: Take a look at the brown trousers in the second and last cubbies of the middle dresser.\\ \tt User: I want something like the light blue jeans in the right middle cubby, except with a good rating.\\ \tt System: All I have are those two pairs.\\ \tt User: Could you compare them?\\ \tt System: The left pair is dark blue while the right one is light blue.\\ \tt User: How much are the dark blue ones?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 53, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt 45, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The ones in the leftmost cubby?
