	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm thinking about treating myself today.  What have you got in expensive sweaters?\\ \tt System: For expensive sweaters, I have the Christmas one in the middle cabinet, and on the table I have the red one at the top left, and the red and white one next to it.\\ \tt User: I want to know the price of the red one, please.\\ \tt System: Which red one do you mean?  They all have some red.\\ \tt User: The red one at the top left, I mean.\\ \tt System: That is 154.99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 14, sweater, red, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: have you got anything similar in sizes to that one?
