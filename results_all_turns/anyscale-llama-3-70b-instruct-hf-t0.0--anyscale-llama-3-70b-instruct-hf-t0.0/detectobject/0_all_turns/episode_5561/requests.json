Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Hi, how's it going today?  I'm looking to get some t-shirts for vacation, could you show me some options?\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the yellow shirt hanging up on the rack to the left of the hat display?  If that color's too strong for you, you might also like the blue and white shirt on the near side of the same rack.\nUser: Do you have any with good customer reviews?  I'm not really trying to waste my money.\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have any shirts with good customer ratings currently in stock.\nUser: What about something with a design by Uptown Studio?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description in my inventory.  Could I help you find something else?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
