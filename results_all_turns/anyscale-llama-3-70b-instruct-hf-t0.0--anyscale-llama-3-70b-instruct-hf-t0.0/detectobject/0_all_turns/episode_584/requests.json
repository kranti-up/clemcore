Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: You've got a lot of shirts!  Which of all of these have good ratings?\nSystem: I've got the brown one at the bottom right, the gray one at the top middle, and the gray-brown one two to the right of it.\nUser: I'd like something like the gray one in the middle, or the brown one at the bottom.\nSystem: I've got the gray one, the gray-brown one in the same row, and the dark pink one in the bottom middle.\nUser: Which of the ones with vertical stripes are affordable?\nSystem: Unfortunately, none of them are.  May I help you find something else?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n27, shirt, grey, XS\n21, shirt, brown, M\n33, dress, dark brown, M\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: I'd like to get that brown dress.
