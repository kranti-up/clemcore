	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have plain-color dresses in a medium size?\\ \tt System: Sure! I can offer you the purple dress on our right (of the two purple dresses there, please look at the one on the right); the brown one on the far side of the floor hanger on the left, and the red one on the left side of the same hanger. Do any of these interest you?\\ \tt User: Yes, I will take the brown one and the red one, pease.\\ \tt System: Certainly! I am adding them to your cart now.\\ \tt User: I would also be interested in another dress like the purple one or the red one, but with positive customer ratings.\\ \tt System: You might also like the violet dress on our immediate left, the brown one on the far side of the same hanger, or the other purple dress on the right-hand floor hanger\\ \tt User: What sizes are the red dress and the first purple one?\\ \tt System: Could you please help me find the dresses you are interested in?\\ \tt User: Sure, I am interested in the red dress on our left, right behind the violet one, and the first purple dress from the left  on teh hanger on our right.\\ \tt System: Thanks! The red dress is shown in XL, and the purple one in XXL.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 47, dress, red, XL\\ \tt 51, sweater, black, S\\ \tt 31, dress, purple, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: OK, I will take the red dress and the second purple dress from the left on the hanger on our right.
