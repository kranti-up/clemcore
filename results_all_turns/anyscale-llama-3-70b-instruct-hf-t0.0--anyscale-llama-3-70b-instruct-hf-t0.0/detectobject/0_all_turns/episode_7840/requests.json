Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a nice top.\nSystem: How about the green, violet, and pink one in the left-hand cupboard, thegrey and white one in the right-hand cupboard, and the red, white, and yellow one on the floor hanger right in front of us?\nUser: OK, can we look only at tops with a light spots pattern that are from Downtown Stylists?\nSystem: I  cannot find any tops with these characteristics, unfortunately.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description.
