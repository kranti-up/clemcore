Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: I need a coffee table to reflect my Arts & Crafts style home.\nSystem: I will suggest the wooden table to your left and the wooden table to your right.\nUser: I like that couch though! Can you show me grey sofas with whatever brand that is?\nSystem: The closest option we have is the far grey sofa on your right.\nUser: Are any of these tables made of wood?\nSystem: Both coffee tables are wooden.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, Sofa, grey, NA\n2, EndTable, white, NA\n0, EndTable, black, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: How is that white end table rated and the black one? They look interesting, but kinda like they'd fall apart."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-58f12e15-0899-41a0-8d6f-465d51b9a386", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID: 0, 2", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1715910500, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 9, "prompt_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 363}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 01:48:19.187167", "call_duration": "0:00:01.863794", "response": "ObjectID: 0, 2", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-70b-instruct-hf"}}}]
