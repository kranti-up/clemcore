	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. Is there a hoodie?\\ \tt System: There's a brown hoodie in the leftmost cubby of the right dresser, the brown one in the back left rack, and the brown one in the middle left rack.\\ \tt User: Is there anything with a good rating?\\ \tt System: The green hoodie in the middle dress, right cubby has a good rating, as well as a green hoodie in the back right rack and a blue hoodie in the right middle rack.\\ \tt User: I really need a jacket, actually.\\ \tt System: Tell me if you like the blue jacket and the light grey jacket in the back left rack, as well as the light grey jacket in the far left cubby of the left dresser.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 106, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Could you compare the size and available sizes of the black jacket in the left dresser, and the other black one in the front left rack.
