	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hey, do you have any cool hoodies?\\ \tt System: I think you may like the green hoodie on the back wall, the blue hoodie on the front rack or the green hoodie hanging next to the blue one.\\ \tt User: Actually, do you have any shirts with good ratings?\\ \tt System: Here's some that I found. Take a look at the green shirt on the rack or the blue button up shirt on the center display.\\ \tt User: Do you have something in the same pattern as the blue shirt but with better ratings?\\ \tt System: This the closest option to what you want.\\ \tt User: What's the price and brand on the green shirt on the rack?\\ \tt System: Sorry, which item?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 30, shirt, blue, XXL\\ \tt 24, shirt, green, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The green shirt on the rack to the left.
