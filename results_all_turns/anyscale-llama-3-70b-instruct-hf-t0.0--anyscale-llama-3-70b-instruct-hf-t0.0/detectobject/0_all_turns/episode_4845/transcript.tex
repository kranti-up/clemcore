	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I am looking for a classy quality jacket, what can you suggest?\\ \tt System: I can recommend the second the blue and green jacket on top of the rack on our left and two jackets on the floor hanger at the wall in front of us, the red and white one and the blue one on our side of the rack.\\ \tt User: Which of these jackets would fit my style better?\\ \tt System: I would include the dark green and blue jacket on our immediate  left, the blue jacket on our side of the floor hanger, and the black jacket in the top row in the cupboard on the wall on the left.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 14, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 2, jacket, light blue, light green, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What else can you suggest?
