	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: What jacket here is nice?\\ \tt System: I have two good jackets for you, the grey one in the top row on the right and the brown one hanging second on the floor hanger on the left\\ \tt User: OK, what dresses are nice?\\ \tt System: Take a look at three dresses on the floor rack on our immediate left: the black one hanging on teh further side of the rack with its back to us; the dark pink one, also on the other side and with its back to us; an the black one on the  left.\\ \tt User: Nice! I will take the dark pink one and the black one, please.\\ \tt System: Sure! I  have added them to your cart.\\ \tt User: Can look only at expensive options?\\ \tt System: In this case, you have the same dark pink dress you just saw plus two more dresses to consider: the maroon one on the right side of the same hanger and the black one hanging with its back to us.\\ \tt User: Awesome! I am buying the maroon one and the black one.\\ \tt System: Got it! They will be in your cart in a moment.\\ \tt User: Thanks! How about a nice top from Yogi Fit?\\ \tt System: Do you like the red, white, and yellow blouse in the bottom row?\\ \tt User: I do, does it have good customer ratings?\\ \tt System: I am sorry, could you help me understand what item you are interested in?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 15, dress, dark pink, M\\ \tt 66, dress, black, L\\ \tt 16, dress, black, L\\ \tt 17, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 5, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yeah, I am looking at the red, white, and yellow top in the bottom row.
