Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs.

If you would be so good as to add it to my cart I'd be mighty thankful! And throw that white lamp on the ground by the green lamp in while you're at it.\nSystem: You got it!
