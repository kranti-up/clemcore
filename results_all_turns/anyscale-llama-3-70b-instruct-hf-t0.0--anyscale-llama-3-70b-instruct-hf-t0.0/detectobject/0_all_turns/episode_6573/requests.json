Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Can you find me a nice natural fiber chair? I'd like an expensive one.\nSystem: No problem. What do you think of the green one in back by the separator wall.\nUser: Do you have any other rugs like that one under the chair? I like the look of it.\nSystem: That rug or the black and white one nearer to us might interest you.\nUser: Do you have any that are also affordable?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have any that fit your request.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n5, AreaRug, grey, NA\n4, EndTable, black, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok.
