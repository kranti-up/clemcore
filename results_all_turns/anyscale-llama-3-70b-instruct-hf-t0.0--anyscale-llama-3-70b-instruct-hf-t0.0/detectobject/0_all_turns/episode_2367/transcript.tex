	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there, I'm looking for a hoodie with long sleeves and good reviews.\\ \tt System: Sure, there's a brown hoodie at the top right, and a blue hoodie near the back, also hanging up high.\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets in XS?\\ \tt System: Sure, the red and white ones to the left of the brown hoodie are all XS.\\ \tt User: Can I have the brand?\\ \tt System: For which one?\\ \tt User: The red and white jacket in the middle.\\ \tt System: Sure, it's from Coats & More.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 13, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt 11, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the brand and price for the two pairs of blue jeans?
