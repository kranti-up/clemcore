	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want an expensive jacket with good reviews.\\ \tt System: Take a look at this light blue, light green one on the back of the center table, this black one on the floor rack, and this blue one on the floor rack.\\ \tt User: Which jacket goes best with my style?\\ \tt System: I could search for some more jackets. Have a look at this dark green and dark blue one at the front of the center table, this black one on the floor rack, and this red and white one on the floor rack.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 15, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 3, jacket, dark green, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 14, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What's the difference of the red and white one and the dark green and dark blue one?
