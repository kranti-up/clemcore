Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which jacket here is in my style?\nSystem: Take a look at the black jacket on our immediate left and the grey one next to it; then, look at the blue jacket in the bottom row on the wall in front of us.\nUser: I like the blue one on the wall, so please drag one into my cart.\nSystem: Sure! I have updated your cart to add this jacket.\nUser: Thanks! Can you also tell me who makes the brown dress far away from us and the grey one close to us?\nSystem: I am not sure what dresses you are interested in, could you please explain?\nUser: Sure! I am interested in the brown dress on the floor hanger further away from us and in the grey dress facing us on the floor hanger closer to us.\nSystem: Thanks!
