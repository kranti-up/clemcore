	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me any cheap coats from Cats Are Great?\\ \tt System: I don't have any coats like that.\\ \tt User: What about something in brown with good reviews?\\ \tt System: There are no coats matching that description. Can I show you something else?\\ \tt User: Will you add the brown shirt in the top center and the black shirt to the left to my cart?\\ \tt System: Of course, I'll add them now.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like the brown jacket or the blue, but more affordable and in red and white.\\ \tt System: Sorry, but I don't have anything matching that description.\\ \tt User: Will you add the red, white, and yellow blouse on the bottom right to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure thing. Your cart has been updated with that blouse.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 0, tshirt, brown, L\\ \tt 1, coat, black, L\\ \tt 2, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt 3, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 5, blouse, red, white, yellow, M\\ \tt 10, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you show me an expensive shirt with vertical stripes?
