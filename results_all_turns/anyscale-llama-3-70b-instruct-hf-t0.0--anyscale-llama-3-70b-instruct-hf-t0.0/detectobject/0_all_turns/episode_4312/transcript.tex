	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Let me know if there are any exorbitantly priced trousers here that you recommend.\\ \tt System: Would you like to learn more about the very first pair on the left, the grey trousers two pairs down from that, or the brown trousers on the right?\\ \tt User: Those brown pants should do the trick. It would be real cool if you could cart those for me.\\ \tt System: With pleasure. Those brown pants will be added to your cart.\\ \tt User: I'd also be interested in seeing some shirts with stripes that run length-wise, if you've got any good ones.\\ \tt System: What do you think of that brown and white striped shirt on the rack in the middle of the floor?\\ \tt User: I want something more luxurious that has more impressive reviews.\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I cannot seem to find any expensive shirts with horizontal stripes and good reviews.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 29, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt 22, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 20, jeans, light blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: No biggie, I just wanted to check. Can I get you to look up whether you've got anything  in the same size as those blue jeans on the right or that pair in the very back on the left by the brand Modern Arts?
