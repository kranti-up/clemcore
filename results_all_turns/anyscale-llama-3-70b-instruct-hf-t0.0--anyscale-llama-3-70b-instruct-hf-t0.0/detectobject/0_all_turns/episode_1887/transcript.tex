	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, could you help me look for some classic jeans today, maybe by River Chateau? I might be volunteering next week and don't have a single comfortable pair!\\ \tt System: Of course! What do you think about the light blue ones at the far right?\\ \tt User: I'm not sure, they look a bit too wide in the leg for me. Can you instead let me know what sizes are available for that maroon and that purple dress?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, which ones did you mean?\\ \tt User: The maroon and purple ones that are on the second rack in the back, I mean.\\ \tt System: Yes, for the maroon, we have XL, XXL, XS, M and L. For the purple one, we have XXL, S, XL, M, XS.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 16, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 18, dress, purple, XXL\\ \tt 19, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 4, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Ok, how about, do you have anything like the maroon one in style?
