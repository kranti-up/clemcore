	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Show me some coats.\\ \tt System: Ok, what do you think about this black coat on the right wall?\\ \tt User: Oh, that's not bad! What brand is it? And what sizes does it come in?\\ \tt System: Which item are you referring to?\\ \tt User: The black coat you pointed out.\\ \tt System: That coat is by North Lodge and comes in sizes XS and M through XXL.\\ \tt User: Ok, I'll keep that in mind. What about the black dress in the center and the beige one on the left? How do those compare in terms of cost and label?\\ \tt System: The black dress is by 212 Local and costs .99, while the beige dress is by Fancy Nails and costs .99.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, coat, black, L\\ \tt 8, dress, black, L\\ \tt 4, dress, beige, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: What do you have in XS that's denim?
