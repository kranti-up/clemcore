	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Could you find me some nice hoodies?\\ \tt System: What do you think about this green one on the back left floor rack, the blue one next to it, and the blue one on the front left floor rack?\\ \tt User: What's the difference between the black coat on the front right floor rack and the black coat on the front left floor rack?\\ \tt System: They both are priced at 139.99 with a 4.8 customer review.\\ \tt User: What's the brand of those two hoodies?\\ \tt System: Could you tell me which hoodies you are talking about?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description.
