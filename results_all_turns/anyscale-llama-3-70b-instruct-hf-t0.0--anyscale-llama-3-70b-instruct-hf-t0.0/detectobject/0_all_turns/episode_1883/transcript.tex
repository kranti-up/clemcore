	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there. I need a North Lodge dresses.\\ \tt System: Tell me what you think of the maroon dress on the back, and the other maroon dress on the far right.\\ \tt User: Could you compare their sizes?\\ \tt System: They're both L.\\ \tt User: I want something like those maroon dresser in size.\\ \tt System: The brown and black dress on the left end of the back rack, the brown dress on the rack second from the right, and the beige dress on the right wall, bottom left.\\ \tt User: Just add the green, violet, and pink blouse in the right middle cubby of the front right dresser, and the brown and black dress to my cart?\\ \tt System: Sure, I'll do that now.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 16, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 19, dress, maroon, L\\ \tt 6, blouse, green, violet, pink, XXL\\ \tt 20, dress, brown, black, L\\ \tt 21, trousers, green, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Also, add those green trousers on the end.
