	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any quality green hoodies?\\ \tt System: How about the green hoodie on the far wall, on the bottom row?\\ \tt User: Do you have anything else that comes in a small?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I couldn't find anything for you. Is there anything else I can do for you?\\ \tt User: Yes, I'm looking for a pair of jeans.\\ \tt System: We have three pairs of blue jeans against the wall on the right. The far left pair is blue, the second pair from right is blue and black, and the pair on the right is light blue. What do you think?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 21, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 25, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Plase add the pair of blue jeans on the far left to my cart.
