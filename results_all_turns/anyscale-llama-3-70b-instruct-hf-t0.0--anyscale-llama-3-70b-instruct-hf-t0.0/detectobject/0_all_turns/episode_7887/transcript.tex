	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi. I'm looking for Downtown Consignment shoes.\\ \tt System: You should check out the red shoes on the bottom shelf of the middle island. They are Downtown Consignments.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything like them, but in large?\\ \tt System: The only others I can suggest are the black and white shoes on the same section as the red shoes.\\ \tt User: What is the brand and available sizes for those?\\ \tt System: Which items are you referring to?\\ \tt User: I mean the black and white shoes next to the red shoes?\\ \tt System: Those shoes are available in XS, S, and L and are Art Dens.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 63, shoes, red, L\\ \tt 65, shoes, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Only include well-rated items.
