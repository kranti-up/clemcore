	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello, do you have any t-shirts from The Vegan Baker?  No long sleeves please.\\ \tt System: Sure, what do you think of the dark green shirt hanging up high on the left wall?\\ \tt User: Can I have the size?\\ \tt System: For that shirt I just mentioned or a different item?\\ \tt User: Sorry, yes that dark green shirt.\\ \tt System: Sure, it's a size L.\\ \tt User: What else do you have with good reviews?  I want to spend a fair bit to make sure the quality is good.\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't have any items matching that description.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, tshirt, dark green, L\\ \tt 9, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can you add one of those dark green t-shirts to my cart please?  And also one of the green hoodies hanging down low at the back left.
