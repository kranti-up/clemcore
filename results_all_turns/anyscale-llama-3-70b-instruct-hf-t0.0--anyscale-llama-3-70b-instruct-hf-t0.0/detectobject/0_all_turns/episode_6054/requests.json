Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Please show me your beds.\nSystem: We have two I can show you. Please direct your attention to the mattresses to the back against the wall and to the left.\nUser: What's the difference?\nSystem: Well, actually both are gray and both are memory foam.\nUser: They look like they're from Global Voyager. Are they, perhaps, considered cheap?\nSystem: Unfortunately no, and I actually don't have anything that matches that query.\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n4, Bed, grey, NA\n0, Bed, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Ok.
