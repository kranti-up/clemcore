	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hello. Do you have good hoodies with a full sleeve and in XXL?\\ \tt System: Sure. How about you take a look at the brown hoodie hanging on the top rack next to the blue jacket.\\ \tt User: Which of these items would go best with my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the brown coat to the left of the brown hoodie, the grey coat on the rack to the left, or the grey coat to the left of the brown hoodie?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, coat, brown, XL\\ \tt 3, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Would you give me the brand and available sizes for the brown coat next to the brown hoodie and the grey coat to the right of that?
