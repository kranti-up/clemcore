	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'm hoping you could show me what you have in affordable long sleeve shirts.\\ \tt System: In long sleeve and affordable, I have this blue and white one at the bottom left of the back wall.\\ \tt User: I'd like to see something like the pink sweater second from the left on the top and at the bottom right of the left wall, but in gray.\\ \tt System: I don't happen to have anything like that, unfortunately.  Could I help you find something else?\\ \tt User: Can you tell me what sizes those are?\\ \tt System: Which items do you mean?\\ \tt User: The two pink sweaters I just asked about, I mean.\\ \tt System: Both sweaters are a S.\\ \tt User: Can you tell me the size of the green hoodie closest to me on the right, and the other green one at the bottom right of the far wall?\\ \tt System: Both of those hoodies are a S.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 45, sweater, pink, S\\ \tt 44, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 27, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I get the sizes of those two pink sweaters again please?  And their rating?
