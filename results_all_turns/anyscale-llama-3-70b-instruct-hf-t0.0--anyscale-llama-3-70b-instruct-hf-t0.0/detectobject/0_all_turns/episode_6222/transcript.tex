	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Which tshirt here is good quality?\\ \tt System: May I recommend the purple one at the far end of the top row on the right?\\ \tt User: OK. What do you have in grey and white?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, I cannot find anything in these colors. Would you like my help with another search?\\ \tt User: Yes, can you show me a nice coat?\\ \tt System: First, in the top row on the right, take a look at  the grey coat next to the purple shirt; then, in the same row take a look at the brown coat  that hangs second to last on the right. Then, in the bottom row, find another brown jacket in the middle.\\ \tt User: OK, I am buying the grey and white jacket that hangs second to last in the bottom row and the blue and white shirt on our left, first in its row on the second, taller  table.\\ \tt System: Got it! These items will be in your cart in a second.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 12, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 9, shirt, blue, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: And what do you have from the same brand and with the same pattern as the blue and white shirt?
