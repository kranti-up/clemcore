	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I want a hoodie.\\ \tt System: How about this brown hoodie on the bottom shelf at the far left in the back,  the green hoodie next to it, and the brown hoodie here on the front rack on the floor?\\ \tt User: Anything else?\\ \tt System: What about this green hoodie on the far left floor rack, this brown hoodie in the back of this floor rack in the front, or this blue one at the front of this floor rack here in the front?\\ \tt User: What are the differences between the green hoodie on the far right floor rack and the brown hoodie in the back?\\ \tt System: The green one has full length sleeves and the brown one also has full length sleeves.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 69, hoodie, green, S\\ \tt 77, hoodie, brown, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Got any good Cats Are Great hats?
