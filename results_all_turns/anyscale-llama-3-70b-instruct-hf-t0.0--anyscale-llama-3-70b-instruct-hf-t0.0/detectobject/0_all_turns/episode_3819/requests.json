Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Does this store have any good wooden tables?\nSystem: That table on the greenish blue rug in the back is a great pick!\nUser: Yeah, that's definitely on the right track. I'm nuts about that color, but could you look for something made with natural fibers?\nSystem: Unfortunately, there are no tables that satisfy your search criteria. Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you!\nUser: I still need to find a table.\nSystem: Are you sure I can't interest you in that wooden one back there?\n\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, Table, wooden, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Yeah, I'm sure.
