	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I'd like some fancy pants with glowing reviews.\\ \tt System: How do those brown pants on the left look to you? Or would you prefer the black ones?\\ \tt User: Hold up that grey shirt and the patterned blouse beneath it are just to die for! Who makes those?\\ \tt System: Which items are you asking about?\\ \tt User: Sorry, I'm talking about the two pieces in the middle of the top and bottom rows against the wall to the left in the back.\\ \tt System: The grey shirt is made by Nature Photographers, whereas the brand of the shirt below it is StyleNow Feed.\\ \tt User: Sorry I'm such a spazz, I'm really looking for pants. Show me some options like the brown pants.\\ \tt System: If you like the brown pants, you might also be a fan of the blue trousers.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 3, blouse, grey, white, L\\ \tt 12, blouse, white, grey, S\\ \tt 47, trousers, brown, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Can I also look at some sleeveless dresses?
