	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: I need some blue jeans.\\ \tt System: Check out the blue pair on the left in the cupboard on the left at the far wall.\\ \tt User: OK. Who makes the grey coat on the floor hanger  to the left of the low shelf further away from us and also the grey coat on the floor hanger to the right of that shelf? Do you also have customer ratings for these coats?\\ \tt System: Can you help me find the coats you are interested in?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 76, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 91, coat, grey, XXL\\ \tt 62, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: OK, the first grey coat is on the floor hanger to the left from the lower shelf further away from us. The second grey coat is on the floor hanger to the  right of the shelf.
