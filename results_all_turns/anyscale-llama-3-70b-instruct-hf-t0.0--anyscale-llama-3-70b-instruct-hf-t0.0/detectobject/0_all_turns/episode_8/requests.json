Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Do you have any plain jeans?\nSystem: What do you think of the grey pair on the left?\nUser: Sorry, I misspoke.

I don't have any floral dresses right now.\nUser: How about something with a pattern that will make me look taller? A blouse from New Fashion maybe?\nSystem: I'm sorry.
