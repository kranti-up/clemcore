	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you find me a jacket for my wardrobe?\\ \tt System: We have a red and white one on the left and a light blue and green one on the back display.\\ \tt User: I'll take the shirt on the display and the blue jeans right in front of me.\\ \tt System: Sure. I'll place those in your cart.\\ \tt User: Would you mind comparing reviews of the suits?\\ \tt System: Which ones are your interested in?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, light blue, light green, M\\ \tt 0, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 6, suit, grey, blue, L\\ \tt 5, suit, black, red, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The grey-blue suit on the display and the red one behind it?
