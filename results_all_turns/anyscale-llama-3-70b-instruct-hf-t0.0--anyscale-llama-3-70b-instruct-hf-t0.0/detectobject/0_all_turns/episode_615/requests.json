Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\n\nDilaogue History:\nUser: Which of the blouses here do you think would look best with other pieces I wear a lot?\nSystem: I suggest you take a look at that black and white spotted shirt on the left and the black blouse hanging behind the grey and white jacket.\nUser: How much are they, and what are they rated?\nSystem: Which items are you interested in?\nUser: The black and white top with the polka dots and the black shirt behind the grey and white jacket.\nSystem: The short-sleeved blouse only costs .99 and is rated a 2.6. The long-sleeved one is rated a 3.7 and costs .99.\nUser: Those ratings are weak.
