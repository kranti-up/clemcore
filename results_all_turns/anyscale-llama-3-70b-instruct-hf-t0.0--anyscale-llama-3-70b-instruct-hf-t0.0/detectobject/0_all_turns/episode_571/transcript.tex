	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there any blouses with long sleeves?\\ \tt System: There is a black blouse which matches your search criteria.\\ \tt User: What are its available sizes?\\ \tt System: Clarify which blouse you are referring to.\\ \tt User: I am referring to the black blouse in the closet.\\ \tt System: It is available in S, XS, and M.\\ \tt User: Are there any jackets that you recommend?\\ \tt System: What do you think of the two brown jackets or the grey and white jacket in the closet?\\ \tt User: Is there anything that has the same size and customer review score as the brown jacket on the very right?\\ \tt System: There are several similar items, including the grey and white jacket in the left cubicle.\\ \tt User: Show me something with a similar pattern and customer review score as that jacket, please.\\ \tt System: Sorry, that is the only match.\\ \tt User: Okay, now let's move on to blouses. Are there any which will go with my closet?\\ \tt System: There are several grey and white blouses, as well as a black and white blouse.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 58, blouse, black, S\\ \tt 38, jacket, brown, L\\ \tt 59, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Tell me the size and price of the grey and white jacket.
