	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Hi there! Do you have any coat?\\ \tt System: I found a black coat on the bottom row, second from the right, another black one to its right, and a grey one against the right wall in the front.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything similar in size and color to the two black coats on the bottom row back there?\\ \tt System: The black jacket on the bottom, second from the right, is all I have.\\ \tt User: I wanna make sure it's by 212 local and has long sleeves.\\ \tt System: Nothing I found fits that, sorry. Wanna search again?\\ \tt User: What's the brand and size of the grey jacket in the front right and the other one in the back left?\\ \tt System: Which ones?\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 18, coat, black, XL\\ \tt 22, coat, black, L\\ \tt 8, jacket, grey, M\\ \tt 4, jacket, grey, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: The first grey jacket on the right wall, and the grey jacket on the table in the back left.
