	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Can you show me a sofa chair that is approved by your other customers?\\ \tt System: I recommend two white sofa chairs, the one in front of us and the one at the far end of the next display, on the left.\\ \tt User: Thank you! What shelves are good here?\\ \tt System: We have some wooden shelves in the last display in this room on the right.\\ \tt User: What else can you show me?\\ \tt System: I cannot find anything else; sorry about that.  If you have any other requests, I will be happy to help.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 2, Sofa, grey, NA\\ \tt 12, CouchChair, white, NA\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Yes, please drag the white sofa chair in front of us into my cart. I will also take the gray sofa facing away from the wall in the last display on the left.
