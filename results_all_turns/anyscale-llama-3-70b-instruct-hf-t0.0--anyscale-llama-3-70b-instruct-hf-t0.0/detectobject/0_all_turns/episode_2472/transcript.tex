	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Are there some shirts around here that would be good buys in your opinion?\\ \tt System: That purplish-red one hanging up on the set of shelves to the right is a rare find!\\ \tt User: Wait actually I really need a coat, and I like the look of this light grey one on the little rack up front to the right and the other light grey one hanging above the greyish pants in the middle set of shelves against the wall. What sizes do those come in if I might ask?\\ \tt System: Those light grey coats are both available in the full range of sizes from extra small to extra extra large.\\ \tt User: You know what, I really want something in dark blue by The Vegan Baker.\\ \tt System: I apologize, but I cannot find any dark blue shirts by that brand.\\ \tt User: Hm alright well maybe some jeans in large then?\\ \tt System: Take a look at those light blue jeans on the shelves to the right.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 59, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 8, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 18, tshirt, dark red, L\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Now I'd like to swing back around to that berry-colored shirt. What size is that, and what's the name of the brand?
