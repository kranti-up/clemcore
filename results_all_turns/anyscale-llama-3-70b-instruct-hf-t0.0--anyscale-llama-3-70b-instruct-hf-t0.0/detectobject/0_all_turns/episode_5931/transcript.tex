	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the current utterance to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If an utterance refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. To understand the context better, the dialogue history, if available, is shared under the label 'Dialogue History'.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dilaogue History:\\ \tt User: Do you have any jackets in a size small?\\ \tt System: How is this grey and white jacket on the far right of the last wall unit, or the blue jacket to its left one cabinet, and also a light grey jacket in the fourth section of the first unit.\\ \tt User: How do the blue black jeans on the far right compare to the grey jeans in the last section of the second wall display?\\ \tt System: The blue black ones are displayed in XS and come in XS and XXL, the grey are a size L and available in all sixes XS to XXL.\\ \tt User: Do you have anything with twin colors and good ratings?\\ \tt System: I have this grey jacket on the rack to the left of the hat display.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 77, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt 63, jeans, grey, L\\ \tt 57, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Perfect, I will take it.
