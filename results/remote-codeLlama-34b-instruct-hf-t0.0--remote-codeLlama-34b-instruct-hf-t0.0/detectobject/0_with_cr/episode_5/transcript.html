        <p>User: I think I feel ever so slightly inclined towards the one on the far left. How does one compare to the solid light grey tank?<br/>System: The long-sleeved blouse is rated more highly. It has a 3.8, in comparison to the light grey tank&#x27;s rating of 2.9. The blouse on the left is also available in more sizes. It comes in small, large, extra large, and extra extra large, while the grey tank is only available in medium at this time. While the tank features a solid pattern in a nice light grey color, the top on the left features a holiday pattern in a maroon, white, and blue color scheme. The brands of these shirts also differ. The tank is made by Brain Puzzles, while the long-sleeved blouse is made by Global Voyager. The actual sizes of these pieces are also different. The tank is a medium, while the long-sleeved top is a small. Last but not least, these shirts are both priced at $39.99.<br/></p>
