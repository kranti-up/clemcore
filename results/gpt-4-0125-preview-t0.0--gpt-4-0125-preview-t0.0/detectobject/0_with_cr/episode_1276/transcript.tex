	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 4, jacket, red, white, XS\\ \tt 15, jacket, dark green, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 0, coat, black, L\\ \tt 2, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt 18, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I need to update my running gear. Any affordable hoodies in S?\\ \tt System: Sorry, I don't see anything in that price range and also size S.\\ \tt User: Can I include things with half sleeves?\\ \tt System: I don't see anything like that.\\ \tt User: What are the ratings and sizing of the two jackets?\\ \tt System: Could you describe the items again?\\ \tt User: The red and white jacket on the left wall and the dark blue and green jacket on the right table.\\ \tt System: The red and white jacket is rated 3.3 and comes in XS and L. The dark green one is rated 5.0 and comes in XS.\\ \tt
