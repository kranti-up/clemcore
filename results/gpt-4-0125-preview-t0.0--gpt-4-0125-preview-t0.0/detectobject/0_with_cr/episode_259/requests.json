Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n1, AreaRug, red, NA\n4, AreaRug, white, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Can you help me find a cheap Modern Arts chair?\nSystem: Sorry, but I don't have any Modern Arts chairs that are inexpensive.\nUser: Can you tell me the price and rating of the area rug on the left and center?\nSystem: Can you clarify which rugs you mean?\nUser: I mean the red rug in the back left of the room, and the white one in the center under the island.\nSystem: The one in back goes for $199 and has a rating of 3.8.
