	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 7, tshirt, red, XS\\ \tt 11, tshirt, green, XL\\ \tt 27, tshirt, yellow, S\\ \tt 24, shirt, purple, S\\ \tt 15, shirt, olive, white, S\\ \tt 4, coat, light grey, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: I need a new tee, can you pick some out to match the rest of my closet?\\ \tt System: Yes, I can help with that. I found three on this table display you might like. There's a red tee in the center of the top shelf, a green tee underneath that, and a yellow tee on the bottom shelf on the lower left.\\ \tt

	 User: That green one isn't bad. Do you have anything with the same sizes as it, but sleeveless and more affordable?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, I don't have anything currently available that fits that description.\\ \tt User: Alright, that's fine. What about a short-sleeve from Uptown Gallery?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately I don't have anything by that description either. Can I help with something else?\\ \tt User: Yes, can you compare the purple shirt that's on the bottom shelf next to the yellow shirt to the olive and white one that's near the green shirt?\\ \tt System: Of course! The purple shirt, displayed in size S, is $79.99 and the olive and white shirt, also displayed in size S, costs $74.99.\\ \tt
