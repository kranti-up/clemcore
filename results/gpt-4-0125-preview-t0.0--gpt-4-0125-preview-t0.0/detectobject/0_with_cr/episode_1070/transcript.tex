	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 1, dress, black, M\\ \tt 5, dress, black, M\\ \tt 6, jacket, black, S\\ \tt 15, jacket, brown, S\\ \tt 4, jacket, brown, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Hey! I'm wondering if you could help me find a dress by Downtown Stylists today for a dance this evening. Something with short sleeves please!\\ \tt System: I would be delighted to help! Let me know your thoughts on the black dress hanging at the top right, or the one on the left side of the rack.\\ \tt

	 User: No, black definitely won't do. I was hoping for something a bit more lively, but that's ok. I also need a jacket for a trip later this week, would you have any to show?\\ \tt System: Of course!
