Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n29, hat, green, XS\n31, hat, black, S\n23, hat, dirty green, XXL\n22, hat, dirty green, XXL\n3, coat, brown, XL\n4, coat, brown, XL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Hey, do you have any cool hats you can show me?  Something that says I'm just trying to hang out.\nSystem: Sure, how do you like the black hat on your near right?  The camo hat right past it is also good for a casual look, and the dirty green beanie past that one would be a good outdoor hat.
