	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 11, blouse, white, black, S\\ \tt 3, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Are there any low-priced coats here that you approve of?\\ \tt System: I apologize, but I cannot find any cheap coats.\\ \tt User: Okay well what do those black and white shirts cost?\\ \tt System: Could you identify more precisely which shirts you are looking at?\\ \tt User: Right it's the black one hanging at the back of that first group of clothes on the bottom level, and then there's another black and white top hanging up in the back next to a pink sweater.\\ \tt System: The blouse hanging beneath the studded black tank costs $39.99, while the blouse hanging next to the pink sweater costs $19.99.\\ \tt
