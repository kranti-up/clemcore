	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 53, blouse, black, XL\\ \tt 54, blouse, black, white, S\\ \tt 51, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 52, jacket, blue, S\\ \tt 13, jeans, dark blue, XS\\ \tt 14, jeans, blue, black, XS\\ \tt 12, jeans, blue, M\\ \tt 79, blouse, white, black, red, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Which of the blouses here do you think would look best with other pieces I wear a lot?\\ \tt System: I suggest you take a look at that black and white spotted shirt on the left and the black blouse hanging behind the grey and white jacket.\\ \tt
