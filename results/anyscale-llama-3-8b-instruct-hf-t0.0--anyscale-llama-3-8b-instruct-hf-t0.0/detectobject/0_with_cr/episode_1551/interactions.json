Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, jacket, light grey, XL\n15, jacket, blue, S\n40, jacket, blue, S\n20, coat, light grey, XL\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: Do you have any cheap jackets?\nSystem: I have a couple!  At the back wall you can see a few rows of hanging clothes.  The light grey jacket in the middle of the top row is pretty cheap.  Next is a blue jacket up close on the left on the bottom.  Finally, there's another blue one at the very front on the top left.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:24.300533", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n6\n15\n40"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:24.301120", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [6, 15, 40], "groundtruth": [6, 15, 40]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:24.301283", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:24.301466", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "User: Do you have anything similar to that light grey one or maybe the black one on the far right, but from StyleNow Feed in  a camouflage pattern?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything like that.\nUser: What's the brand of the light grey one at the back and the blue one down low on the left wall?\nSystem: The blue one is from Global Voyager and the light grey one is from 212 Local.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:25.414822", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n6\n15\n40"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:25.415352", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [6, 15, 40], "groundtruth": [40, 6]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:25.415488", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:25.415637", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "User: Are there any more?\nSystem: Sorry, I don't have anything else.\nUser: What do you have from StyleNow feed with good reviews.\nSystem: There's another light grey coat at the bottom right of the same section with the other light grey jacket.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:26.733249", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n6\n15\n40"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:26.733767", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [6, 15, 40], "groundtruth": [20]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:26.733902", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:26.734023", "action": {"type": "info", "content": "game successful"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:05:26.734135", "action": {"type": "info", "content": "end game"}}]], "n_turns": 3, "Played turns": 3, "Complete turns": 3, "Aborted": false, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [0, 1, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [0, 1, 1, 1], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 0, 0], "Evaluation": {"1": {"groundtruth": [6, 15, 40], "prediction": [6, 15, 40]}, "2": {"groundtruth": [40, 6], "prediction": [6, 15, 40]}, "3": {"groundtruth": [20], "prediction": [6, 15, 40]}}}
