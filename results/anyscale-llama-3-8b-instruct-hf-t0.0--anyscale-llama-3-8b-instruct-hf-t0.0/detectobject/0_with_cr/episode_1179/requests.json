Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n6, Sofa, red, NA\n0, Sofa, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: I'm looking for a new rug on a budget.  What can you show me in the affordable range?\nSystem: Unfortunately, I don't have any rugs in that price range?   Would you like to search for something else?\nUser: Could you tell me the customer rating and materials for the chairs?\nSystem: Sorry, there are several in those colors.  Could you specify which ones you want to know about?\nUser: I mean that red sofa on the white patterned rug, and also the gray sofa at the far back on the blue and tan rug.\nSystem: The red one is made of leather and has a 4.9 rating, while the gray one has a 3.1 rating and is also made of leather.\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-01ece888-753c-46af-a4e9-a002a5f84c3b", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "ObjectID\n6\n0", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null}}], "created": 1714135550, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "object": "text_completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 7, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 376}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-04-26 14:45:49.272356", "call_duration": "0:00:01.179137", "response": "ObjectID\n6\n0", "model_name": "anyscale-llama-3-8b-instruct-hf"}}}]
