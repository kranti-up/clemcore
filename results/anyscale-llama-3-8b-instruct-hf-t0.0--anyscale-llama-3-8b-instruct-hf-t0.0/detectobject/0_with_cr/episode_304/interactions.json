Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n2, Shelves, wooden, NA\n3, Shelves, wooden, NA\n0, CoffeeTable, wooden, NA\n1, AreaRug, red, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin\nUser: I'd like to find some wooden shelves, and I'd like to stick to my budget, so something in a mid-range price, please.\nSystem: I don't seem to have any shelves that fit your specifications.  Could I help you with anything else?\nUser: That brown chair between the two gray tables has a nice shape.  Do you have anything like it with natural fibers?  Something expensive!\nSystem: I don't have any chairs like that at the moment, you may want to check back when next season's items come in.\nUser: Well, back to shelves, which of them do you think would work best with my decor?  I like to color-coordinate.\nSystem: Well, wood is always a good choice to coordinate with.  I have the short wooden ones at the left side of the half wall, as well as the light-tone wood cabinet to the right with the drawer and doors.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T13:28:42.204025", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n2\n3"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T13:28:42.204470", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [2, 3], "groundtruth": [2, 3]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T13:28:42.204584", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T13:28:42.204707", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "User: Oh, I can't make up my mind today.
