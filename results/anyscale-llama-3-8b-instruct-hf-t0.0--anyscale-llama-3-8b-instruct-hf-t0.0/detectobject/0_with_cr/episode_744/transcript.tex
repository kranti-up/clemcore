	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 13, hat, white, M\\ \tt 14, hat, green, XS\\ \tt 16, hat, white, M\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Greetings! Would you kindly suggest some shirts?\\ \tt System: I'm sorry, we do not have any shirts.\\ \tt User: Ok, I'm just looking for a gift for my teenage son. How about hats in an XS?\\ \tt System: Yes, for hats, I can suggest the white ones on the table or the camo one behind those. What are your thoughts?\\ \tt

	 User: No, really don't think my son would like those. He's more understated with his tastes. Can you show me other ones?\\ \tt System: Unfortunately, those are the only ones we have in an XS.\\ \tt User: Ok, no problem, maybe I will have to introduce him to things he wouldn't usually pick out for himself. Can you tell me more about the first white one and the camo one please?\\ \tt System: Yes, the white one is available in XS, M, L, S, XXL, XL, while the camo one is available in XS, XXL.\\ \tt
