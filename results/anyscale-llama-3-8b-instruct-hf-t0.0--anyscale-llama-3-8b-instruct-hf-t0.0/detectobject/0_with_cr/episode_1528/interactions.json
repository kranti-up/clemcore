Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description.

I like those, do you have anything with the same available sizes and ratings?\nSystem: I'm sorry, those are the only ones with that criteria.\nUser: Alright, do you have anything in a dirty green color that's only one or two dollar signs?\nSystem: I'm sorry,  I don't see anything like that either.\nUser: Wow. Let's try a plain patterned coat with good reviews. Anything like that?\nSystem: I have one behind the hoodie on the left and two on the right next  to the table, have a look.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:56.601902", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n28"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:56.602215", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [28], "groundtruth": [18, 12, 19]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:56.602314", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:56.602430", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "User: I'll take that dirty green hat on the far right and the second coat on the left, please.\nSystem: I'll put those in your cart for you.\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:57.539981", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "ObjectID\n28\n19"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:57.540490", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": {"prediction": [28, 19], "groundtruth": [28, 18]}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:57.540624", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "answer confirms to rules"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:57.540745", "action": {"type": "info", "content": "game successful"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-26T15:03:57.540856", "action": {"type": "info", "content": "end game"}}]], "n_turns": 2, "Played turns": 2, "Complete turns": 2, "Aborted": false, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [0, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [0, 1, 1], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 0], "Evaluation": {"1": {"groundtruth": [18, 12, 19], "prediction": [28]}, "2": {"groundtruth": [28, 18], "prediction": [28, 19]}}}
