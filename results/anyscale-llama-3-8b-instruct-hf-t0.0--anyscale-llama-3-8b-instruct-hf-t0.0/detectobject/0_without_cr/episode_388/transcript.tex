	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 40, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 41, trousers, grey, XS\\ \tt 16, coat, black, L\\ \tt 9, coat, black, L\\ \tt 7, coat, black, XL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Please show me some grey pants.\\ \tt System: Do you like either grey pair in the center of the right wall?\\ \tt

I'd like to get something in their price range and brand but made from denim. And I need a size XXL.\\ \tt System: I wasn't able to find a match.\\ \tt User: What about an expensive coat then?\\ \tt System: There are three black coats on the right wall that I'd like to draw your attention to. They are located in the second, third, and fifth sections.\\ \tt
