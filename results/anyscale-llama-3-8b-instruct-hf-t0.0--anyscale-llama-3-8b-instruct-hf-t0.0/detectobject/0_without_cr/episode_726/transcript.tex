	 You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying specific object IDs from references made in conversation snippets.\\ \tt \\ \tt The scene contains multiple objects, each identified by an ID and characterized by attributes including name, color, and size. Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\\ \tt \\ \tt Below is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt object_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\\ \tt 10, jacket, blue, L\\ \tt 9, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 1, jacket, black, XL\\ \tt 5, jacket, grey, white, XS\\ \tt 22, hat, dirty green, XXL\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Your response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text or explanations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin\\ \tt User: Got any good jackets around here?\\ \tt System: Check out those jackets on the set of shelves to the right! Do either of those black options speak to you? Or would you consider that royal blue between them?\\ \tt

Which one would save me some dough, and what sizes could I get both of them in?\\ \tt System: The blue one is considerably less expensive, at $99.99 in comparison to the black jacket's price of $174.99. The blue jacket is available in a large, while the black jacket comes in small and extra large.\\ \tt
