Analyze the conversation to determine which objects are being mentioned based on their described attributes. Match these details with the attributes of objects in the scene to accurately identify and return the corresponding object IDs. If a conversation refers to multiple objects, detect and respond with all relevant object IDs. Ensure that you do not repeat the previously detected ObjectID list again for the current conversation.\n\nBelow is the scene description. Each line contains a tuple with the format (object_id, type, color, size), describing each object in the scene.\n\nobject_id, object_type, object_color, object_size\n2, Sofa, grey, NA\n\n\nYour response should list the matched object IDs under the label 'ObjectID', followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text or explanations.\n\nLet's begin"}
